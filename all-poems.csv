"I leaned against the mantel, sick, sick,
Thinking of my failure, looking into the abysm,
Weak from the noon-day heat.
A church bell sounded mournfully far away,
I heard the cry of a baby,
And the coughing of John Yarnell,
Bed-ridden, feverish, feverish, dying,
Then the violent voice of my wife:
""Watch out, the potatoes are burning!""
I smelled them ... then there was irresistible disgust.
I pulled the trigger ... blackness ... light ...
Unspeakable regret ... fumbling for the world again.
Too late! Thus I came here,
With lungs for breathing ... one cannot breathe here with lungs,
Though one must breathe
Of what use is it To rid one's self of the world,
When no soul may ever escape the eternal destiny of life?",0
"I was the first fruits of the battle of Missionary Ridge.
When I felt the bullet enter my heart
I wished I had staid at home and gone to jail
For stealing the hogs of Curl Trenary,
Instead of running away and joining the army.
Rather a thousand times the county jail
Than to lie under this marble figure with wings,
And this granite pedestal Bearing the words, Pro Patria.
What do they mean, anyway?",0
"I was only eight years old;
And before I grew up and knew what it meant
I had no words for it, except
That I was frightened and told my
Mother; And that my Father got a pistol
And would have killed Charlie, who was a big boy,
Fifteen years old, except for his Mother.
Nevertheless the story clung to me.
But the man who married me, a widower of thirty-five,
Was a newcomer and never heard it
Till two years after we were married.
Then he considered himself cheated,
And the village agreed that I was not really a virgin.
Well, he deserted me, and I died
The following winter.",0
"Why should I blame her that she filled my days
With misery, or that she would of late
Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,
Or hurled the little streets upon the great,
Had they but courage equal to desire?
What could have made her peaceful with a mind
That nobleness made simple as a fire,
With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind
That is not natural in an age like this,
Being high and solitary and most stern?
Why, what could she have done, being what she is?
Was there another Troy for her to burn?",0
"GLOOM! 
An October like November; 
August a hundred thousand hours, 
And all September, 
A hundred thousand, dragging sunlit days, 
And half October like a thousand years . . . 
And doom! 
That then was Antwerp. . . 
In the name of God, 
How could they do it? 
Those souls that usually dived 
Into the dirty caverns of mines; 
Who usually hived 
In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars; 
Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud, 
Lumbering to work over the greasy sods. . . 
Those men there, with the appearance of clods 
Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God 
Ever shrived. . . 
And it is not for us to make them an anthem. 
If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them 
To a tune that the trumpets might blow it, 
Shrill through the heaven that's ours or yet Allah's, 
Or the wide halls of any Valhallas. 
We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours 
For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays 
Is this: 
In the name of God, how could they do it? 

For there is no new thing under the sun, 
Only this uncomely man with a smoking gun 
In the gloom. . . 
What the devil will he gain by it? 
Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it 
Waiting his doom; 
The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, 
Till the trench of gray mud 
Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. 
Well, there have been scars 
Won in many wars . . .
Punic, 
Lacedmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, 
But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, 
His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, 
Overspreading his miserable land, 
Standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . 
Doom! 
He finds that in a sudden scrimmage, 
And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . 
An image that shall take long to pass! 

For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses 
Forever through our brains. 
The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; 
And battalions and battalions and battalions 
The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, 
Pass, for ever staunch, 
Stand, for ever true; 
And the small man with the large paunch, 
And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, 
Watches them pass 
In our minds for ever . . . 
But that clutter of sodden corses 
On the sodden Belgian grass 
That is a strange new beauty. 
With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, 
Assuredly that is the way of it, 
The way of beauty . . . 
And that is the highest word you can find to say of it. 
For you cannot praise it with words 
Compounded of lyres and swords, 
But the thought of the gloom and the rain 
And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, 
Shall eat itself into your brain: 
And you will say of all heroes, They fought like the Belgians! 
And you will say: He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom. 
And you will say: He bought like a Belgian his doom. 
And that shall be an honourable name; 
Belgian shall be an honourable word; 
As honourable as the fame of the sword, 
As honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, 
And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. 

And what in the world did they bear it for? 
I don't know. 
And what in the world did they dare it for? 
Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. 
They could very well have watched a hundred legions go 
Over their fields and between their cities 
Down into more southerly regions. 
They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, 
And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. 
I don't understand. 
Was it just love of their land? 
Oh, poor dears! 
Can any man so love his land? 
Give them a thousand thousand pities 
And rivers and rivers of tears 
To wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. 

This is Charing Cross; 
It is midnight; 
There is a great crowd 
And no light. 
A great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. 
Surely, that is a dead womana dead mother! 
She has a dead face; 
She is dressed all in black; 
She wanders to the bookstall and back, 
At the back of the crowd; 
And back again and again back, 
She sways and wanders. 

This is Charing Cross; 
It is one o'clock. 
There is still a great cloud, and very little light; 
Immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd 
That hardly whispers aloud. . . 
And now! . . That is another dead mother, 
And there is another and another and another. . . 
And little children, all in black, 
All with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, 
Wandering from the doors of the waiting-room 
In the dim gloom. 
These are the women of Flanders.
They await the lost. 
They await the lost that shall never leave the dock; 
They await the lost that shall never again come by the train 
To the embraces of all these women with dead faces; 
They await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, 
In the dark of the night. 
This is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; 
There is very little light. 

There is so much pain. 

And it was for this that they endured this gloom; 
This October like November, 
That August like a hundred thousand hours, 
And that September, 
A hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, 
And half October like a thousand years. . . 
Oh, poor dears!",0
"As I went up by Ovillers
 In mud and water cold to the knee,
There went three jeering, fleering spectres,
 That walked abreast and talked of me.
 
The first said, Heres a right brave soldier
 That walks the dark unfearingly;
Soon hell come back on a fine stretcher,
 And laughing for a nice Blighty.
 
The second, Read his face, old comrade,
 No kind of lucky chance I see;
One day hell freeze in mud to the marrow,
 Then look his last on Picardie.
 
Though bitter the word of these first twain
 Curses the third spat venomously;
Hell stay untouched till the wars last dawning
 Then live one hour of agony.
 
Liars the first two were. Behold me
 At sloping arms by one two three;
Waiting the time I shall discover
 Whether the third spake verity.",0
"She was a village
Of lovely knowledge
The high roads left her aside, she was forlorn, a maid 
Water ran there, dusk hid her, she climbed four-wayed.
Brown-gold windows showed last folk not yet asleep;
Water ran, was a centre of silence deep,
Fathomless deeps of pricked sky, almost fathomless
Hallowed an upward gaze in pale satin of blue.
And I was happy indeed, of mind, soul, body even
Having got given
A sign undoubtful of a dear England few
Doubt, not many have seen,
That Will Squele he knew and was so shriven.
Home of Twelfth Night Edward Thomas by Arras fallen,
Borrow and Hardy, Sussex tales out of Roman heights callen.
No madrigals or field-songs to my all reverent whim;
Till I got back I was dumb.",0
"If it were not for England, who would bear
This heavy servitude one moment more?
To keep a brothel, sweep and wash the floor
Of filthiest hovels were noble to compare
With this brass-cleaning life. Now here, now there
Harried in foolishness, scanned curiously o'er
By fools made brazen by conceit, and store
Of antique witticisms thin and bare.

Only the love of comrades sweetens all,
Whose laughing spirit will not be outdone.
As night-watching men wait for the sun
To hearten them, so wait I on such boys
As neither brass nor Hell-fire may appal,
Nor guns, nor sergeant-major's bluster and noise.",0
"Only the wanderer
 Knows England's graces,
Or can anew see clear
 Familiar faces.

And who loves joy as he
 That dwells in shadows?
Do not forget me quite,
 O Severn meadows.",0
"Little did I dream, England, that you bore me
Under the Cotswold hills beside the water meadows,
To do you dreadful service, here, beyond your borders
And your enfolding seas.
 
I was a dreamer ever, and bound to your dear service,
Meditating deep, I thought on your secret beauty,
As through a child's face one may see the clear spirit
Miraculously shining.
 
Your hills not only hills, but friends of mine and kindly,
Your tiny knolls and orchards hidden beside the river
Muddy and strongly flowing, with shy and tiny streamlets
Safe in its bosom.
 
Now these are memories only, and your skies and rushy sky-pools
Fragile mirrors easily broken by moving airs ...
But deep in my heart for ever goes on your daily being,
And uses consecrate.
 
Think on me too, O Mother, who wrest my soul to serve you
In strange and fearful ways beyond your encircling waters;
None but you can know my heart, its tears and sacrifice;
None, but you, repay.",0
"He's gone, and all our plans
 Are useless indeed.
We'll walk no more on Cotswold
 Where the sheep feed
 Quietly and take no heed.
 
His body that was so quick
 Is not as you
Knew it, on Severn river
 Under the blue
 Driving our small boat through.
 
You would not know him now ...
 But still he died
Nobly, so cover him over
 With violets of pride
 Purple from Severn side.
 
Cover him, cover him soon!
 And with thick-set
Masses of memoried flowers
 Hide that red wet
 Thing I must somehow forget.",0
"Now, youth, the hour of thy dread passion comes;
Thy lovely things must all be laid away;
And thou, as others, must face the riven day
Unstirred by rattle of the rolling drums,
Or bugles' strident cry. When mere noise numbs
The sense of being, the sick soul doth sway,
Remember thy great craft's honour, that they may say
Nothing in shame of poets. Then the crumbs
Of praise the little versemen joyed to take
Shall be forgotten; then they must know we are,
For all our skill in words, equal in might
And strong of mettle as those we honoured; make
The name of poet terrible in just war,
And like a crown of honour upon the fight.",0
"When I remember plain heroic strength
And shining virtue shown by Ypres pools,
Then read the blither written by knaves for fools
In praise of English soldiers lying at length,
Who purely dream what England shall be made
Gloriously new, free of the old stains
By us, who pay the price that must be paid,
Will freeze all winter over Ypres plains.
Our silly dreams of peace you put aside
And brotherhood of man, for you will see
An armed mistress, braggart of the tide,
Her children slaves, under your mastery.
We'll have a word there too, and forge a knife,
Will cut the cancer threatens England's life.",0
"So in Pieria, from the wedded bliss
Of Time and Memory, the Muses came
To be the means of rich oblivion,
And rest from cares. And when the Thunderer
Took heaven, then the Titans warred on him
For pity of mankind. But the great law,
Which is the law of music, not of bread,
Set Atlas for a pillar, manacled
His brother to the rocks of the Scythia,
And under Aetna fixed the furious Typhon.
So should thought rule, not force. And Amphion,
Pursuing justice, entered Thebes and slew
His mother's spouse; but when he would make sure
And fortify the city, then he took
The lyre that Hermes gave, and played, and watched
The stones move and assemble, till a wall
Engirded Thebes and kept the citadel
Beyond the reach of arrows and of fire.
What other power but harmony can build
A city, and what gift so magical
As that by which a city lifts its walls?
So men, in years to come, shall feel the power
Of this man moving through the high-ranged thought
Which plans for beauty, builds for larger life.
The stones shall rise in towers to answer him.",0
"My bands of silk and miniver
Momently grew heavier;
The black gauze was beggarly thin;
The ermine muffled mouth and chin;
I could not suck the moonlight in.

Harlequin in lozenges
Of love and hate, I walked in these
Striped and ragged rigmaroles;
Along the pavement my footsoles
Trod warily on living coals.

Shouldering the thoughts I loathed,
In their corrupt disguises clothed,
Morality I could not tear
From my ribs, to leave them bare
Ivory in silver air.

There I walked, and there I raged;
The spiritual savage caged
Within my skeleton, raged afresh
To feel, behind a carnal mesh,
The clean bones crying in the flesh.",0
"
Behoild Pelides with his yellow hair,
Proud child of Thetis, hero loved of Jove;
Above the frowning of his brows of wove
A crown of gold, well combed, with Spartan care.
Who might have seen him, sullen, great, and fair,
As with the wrongful world he proudly strove,
And by high deeds his wilder passion shrove,
Mastering love, resentment, and despair.
He knew his end, and Phoebus arrow sure
He braved for fame immortal and a friend,
Despising life; and we, who know our end,
Know that in our decay he shall endure
And all our childrens hearts to grief inure,
With whose first bitter battles his shall blend.

Who brought thee forth, immortal vision, who
In Phthia or in Tempe brought thee forth?
Out of the sunlight and the sapful earth
What god the simples of thy spirit drew?
A goddess rose from the green waves, and threw
Her arms about a king, to give thee birth;
A centaur, patron of thy boyish mirth,
Over the meadows in thy footsteps flew.
Now Thessaly forgets thee, and the deep
Thy keeled bark furrowed answers not thy prayer;
But far away new generations keep
Thy laurels fresh; where branching Isis hems
The lawns of Oxford round about, or where
Enchanted Eton sits by pleasant Thames.

I gaze on thee as Phidias of old
Or Polyclitus gazed, when first he saw
These hard and shining limbs, without a flaw,
And cast his wonder in heroic mould.
Unhappy me who only may behold,
Nor make immutable and fix in awe
A fair immortal form no worm shall gnaw,
A tempered mind whose faith was never told!
The godlike mien, the lions lock and eye,
The well-knit sinew, utter a brave heart
Better than many words that part by part
Spell in strange symbols what serene and whole
In nature lives, nor can in marble die.
The perfect body itself the soul.",0
"I had come to the house, in a cave of trees,
Facing a sheer sky.
Everything moved,a bell hung ready to strike,
Sun and reflection wheeled by.

When the bare eyes were before me
And the hissing hair,
Held up at a window, seen through a door.
The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead
Formed in the air.

This is a dead scene forever now.
Nothing will ever stir.
The end will never brighten it more than this,
Nor the rain blur.

The water will always fall, and will not fall,
And the tipped bell make no sound.
The grass will always be growing for hay
Deep on the ground.

And I shall stand here like a shadow
Under the great balanced day,
My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind,
And does not drift away.",0
"There may be chaos still around the world,
This little world that in my thinking lies;
For mine own bosom is the paradise
Where all my lifes fair visions are unfurled.
Within my natures shell I slumber curled,
Unmindful of the changing outer skies,
Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.
I heed them not; or if the subtle night
Haunt me with deities I never saw,
I soon mine eyelids drowsy curtain draw
To hide their myriad faces from my sight.
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe
A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw.",0
"
Another's a half-cracked fellow John Heydon,
Worker of miracles, dealer in levitation,
In thoughts upon pure form, in alchemy,
Seer of pretty visions (""servant of God and secretary of nature""); 
Full of plaintive charm, like Botticelli's,
With half-transparent forms, lacking the vigor of gods.
Thus Heydon, in a trance, at Bulverton,
Had such a sight:
Decked all in green, with sleeves of yellow silk
Slit to the elbow, slashed with various purples.
Her eyes were green as glass, her foot was leaf-like.
She was adorned with choicest emeralds,
And promised him the way of holy wisdom.
""Pretty green bank,"" began the half-lost poem.
Take the old way, say I met John Heydon, 
Sought out the place,
Lay on the bank, was ""plunged deep in swevyn;""
And saw the companyLayamon, Chaucer
Pass each in his appropriate robes;
Conversed with each, observed the varying fashion.
And then comes Heydon.
 ""I have seen John Heydon.""
Let us hear John Heydon!
 ""Omniformis
Omnis intellectus est""thus he begins, by spouting half of Psellus.
(Then comes a note, my assiduous commentator:
Not Psellus De Daemonibus, but Porphyry's Chances,
In the thirteenth chapter, that ""every intellect is omni-form."")
Magnifico Lorenzo used the dodge,
Says that he met Ficino
In some Wordsworthian, false-pastoral manner,
And that they walked along, stopped at a well-head,
And heard deep platitudes about contentment
From some old codger with an endless beard.
""A daemon is not a particular intellect,
But is a substance differed from intellect,""
Breaks in Ficino,
""Placed in the latitude or locus of souls""
That's out of Proclus, take your pick of them.
Valla, more earth and sounder rhetoric
Prefacing praise to his Pope Nicholas:
""A man of parts, skilled in the subtlest sciences;
A patron of the arts, of poetry; and of a fine discernment.""
Then comes a catalogue, his jewels of conversation.
No, you've not read your Elegantiae
A dull book?shook the church.
The prefaces, cut clear and hard:
""Know then the Roman speech, a sacrament,""
Spread for the nations, eucharist of wisdom,
Bread of the liberal arts.
 Ha! Sir Blancatz,
Sordello would have your heart to give to all the princes;
Valla, the heart of Rome,
Sustaining speech, set out before the people.
""Nec bonus Christianus ac bonus
 Tullianus.""
Marius, Du Bellay, wept for the buildings,
Baldassar Castiglione saw Raphael
""Lead back the soul into its dead, waste dwelling,""
Corpore laniato; and Lorenzo Valla,
""Broken in middle life? bent to submission?
Took a fat living from the Papacy""
(That's in Villari, but Burckhardt's statement is different)
""More than the Roman city, the Roman speech""
(Holds fast its part among the ever-living).
""Not by the eagles only was Rome measured.""
""Wherever the Roman speech was, there was Rome,""
Wherever the speech crept, there was mastery
Spoke with the law's voice while your Greek, logicians...
More Greeks than one! Doughty's ""divine Homeros""
Came before sophistry. Justinopolitan
Uncatalogued Andreas Divus,
Gave him in Latin, 1538 in my edition, the rest uncertain,
Caught up his cadence, word and syllable:
""Down to the ships we went, set mast and sail,
Black keel and beasts for bloody sacrifice,
Weeping we went.""
I've strained my ear for -ensa, -ombra, and -ensa
And cracked my wit on delicate canzoni
 Here's but rough meaning:

""And then went down to the ship, set keel to breakers,
Forth on the godly sea;
We set up mast and sail on the swarthy ship,
Sheep bore we aboard her, and our bodies also
Heavy with weeping. And winds from sternward
Bore us out onward with bellying canvas
Circe's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.
Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller.
Thus with stretched sail
 We went over sea till day's end:
Sun to his slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean.
Came we then to the bounds of deepest water,
To the Kimmerian lands and peopled cities
Covered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever
With glitter of sun-rays,
Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven,
Swartest night stretched over wretched men there.
Thither we in that ship, unladed sheep there,
The ocean flowing backward, came we through to the place
Aforesaid by Circe.
Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus,
And drawing sword from my hip
I dug the ell-square pitkin, poured we libations unto each the dead, 
First mead and then sweet wine,
Water mixed with white flour.
Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death's-heads
As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best,
For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods.
Sheep, to Tiresias only,
Black, and a bell sheep;
Dark blood flowed in the fosse.
Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead
Of brides, of youths, and of many passing old,
Virgins tender, souls stained with recent tears,
Many men mauled with bronze lance-heads,
Battle spoil, bearing yet dreary arms:
These many crowded about me,
With shouting, pallor upon me, cried to my men for more beasts;
Slaughtered the herdssheep slain of bronze,
Poured ointment, cried to the gods,
To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine.
Unsheathed the narrow steel,
I sat to keep off the impetuous, impotent dead
Till I should hear Tiresias.
But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor,
Unburied, cast on the wide earth
Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,
Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urged other,
Pitiful spiritand I cried in hurried speech:
'Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?
Cam'st thou afoot, outstripping seamen?' And he in heavy speech:
'Ill fate and abundant wine! I slept in Circe's ingle,
Going down the long ladder unguarded, I fell against the buttress,
Shattered the nape-nerve, the soul sought Avernus.
But thou, O King, I bid remember me, unwept, unburied!
Heap up mine arms, be tomb by the sea-board, and inscribed,
A man of no fortune and with a name to come;
And set my oar up, that I swung 'mid fellows.'
Came then another ghost, whom I beat off, Anticlea,
And then Tiresias, Theban,
Holding his golden wand, knew me and spoke first:
'Man of ill hour, why come a second time,
Leaving the sunlight, facing the sunless dead and this joyless region?
Stand from the fosse, move back, leave me my bloody bever,
And I will speak you true speeches.'
 ""And I stepped back,
Sheathing the yellow sword. Dark blood he drank then
And spoke: 'Lustrous Odysseus, shalt
Return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas,
Lose all companions.' Foretold me the ways and the signs.
Came then Anticlea, to whom I answered:
'Fate drives me on through these deeps; I sought Tiresias.'
I told her news of Troy, and thrice her shadow
Faded in my embrace.
Then had I news of many faded women
Tyro, Alcmena, Chloris
Heard out their tales by that dark fosse, and sailed
By sirens and thence outward and away,
And unto Circe buried Elpenor's corpse.""

 In Officina Wechli, Paris,
M. D. three X's, Eight, with Aldus on the Frogs,
And a certain Cretan's 
 Hymni Deorum:
(The thin clear Tuscan stuff
 Gives way before the florid mellow phrase.)
Take we the Goddess, Venus:
 Venerandam,
Aurean coronam habentem, pulchram,
Cypri munimenta sortita est, maritime,
Light on the foam, breathed on by zephyrs,
And air-tending hours. Mirthful, orichalci, with golden
Girdles and breast bands.
 Thou with dark eye-lids, 
Bearing the golden bough of Argicida.",0
"My love looks like a girl to-night,
 But she is old.
The plaits that lie along her pillow
 Are not gold,
But threaded with filigree silver,
 And uncanny cold.

She looks like a young maiden, since her brow
 Is smooth and fair,
Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.
 She sleeps a rare
Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.

Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams
 Of perfect things.
She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,
 And her dead mouth sings
By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings.",0
"
The mind has shown itself at times
Too much the baked and labeled dough
Divided by accepted multitudes.
Across the stacked partitions of the day
Across the memoranda, baseball scores,
The stenographic smiles and stock quotations
Smutty wings flash out equivocations.

The mind is brushed by sparrow wings;
Numbers, rebuffed by asphalt, crowd
The margins of the day, accent the curbs,
Convoying divers dawns on every corner
To druggist, barber and tobacconist,
Until the graduate opacities of evening
Take them away as suddenly to somewhere
Virginal perhaps, less fragmentary, cool.

 There is the world dimensional for
 those untwisted by the love of things
 irreconcilable ...

And yet, suppose some evening I forgot
The fare and transfer, yet got by that way
Without recall,lost yet poised in traffic.
Then I might find your eyes across an aisle,
Still flickering with those prefigurations
Prodigal, yet uncontested now,
Half-riant before the jerky window frame.

There is some way, I think, to touch
Those hands of yours that count the nights
Stippled with pink and green advertisements.
And now, before its arteries turn dark
I would have you meet this bartered blood.
Imminent in his dream, none better knows
The white wafer cheek of love, or offers words
Lightly as moonlight on the eaves meets snow.

Reflective conversion of all things
At your deep blush, when ecstasies thread
The limbs and belly, when rainbows spread
Impinging on the throat and sides ... 
Inevitable, the body of the world
Weeps in inventive dust for the hiatus
That winks above it, bluet in your breasts.

The earth may glide diaphanous to death;
But if I lift my arms it is to bend
To you who turned away once, Helen, knowing
The press of troubled hands, too alternate
With steel and soil to hold you endlessly.
I meet you, therefore, in that eventual flame
You found in final chains, no captive then
Beyond their million brittle, bloodshot eyes;
White, through white cities passed on to assume
That world which comes to each of us alone.
Accept a lone eye riveted to your plane,
Bent axle of devotion along companion ways
That beat, continuous, to hourless days
One inconspicuous, glowing orb of praise.
Brazen hypnotics glitter here;
Glee shifts from foot to foot,
Magnetic to their tremulo.
This crashing opera bouffe,
Blest excursion! this ricochet
From roof to roof
Know, Olympians, we are breathless
While nigger cupids scour the stars!

A thousand light shrugs balance us
Through snarling hails of melody.
White shadows slip across the floor
Splayed like cards from a loose hand;
Rhythmic ellipses lead into canters
Until somewhere a rooster banters.

Greet naivelyyet intrepidly
New soothings, new amazements
That cornets introduce at every turn
And you may fall downstairs with me
With perfect grace and equanimity.
Or, plaintively scud past shores
Where, by strange harmonic laws
All relatives, serene and cool,
Sit rocked in patent armchairs.

O,I have known metallic paradises
Where cuckoos clucked to finches
Above the deft catastrophes of drums.
While titters hailed the groans of death
Beneath gyrating awnings I have seen
The incunabula of the divine grotesque.
This music has a reassuring way.

The siren of the springs of guilty song
Let us take her on the incandescent wax
Striated with nuances, nervosities
That we are heir to: she is still so young,
We cannot frown upon her as she smiles,
Dipping here in this cultivated storm
Among slim skaters of the gardened skies.

Capped arbiter of beauty in this street
That narrows darkly into motor dawn,
You, here beside me, delicate ambassador
Of intricate slain numbers that arise
In whispers, naked of steel;
 religious gunman!
Who faithfully, yourself, will fall too soon,
And in other ways than as the wind settles
On the sixteen thrifty bridges of the city:
Let us unbind our throats of fear and pity.

 We even,
Who drove speediest destruction
In corymbulous formations of mechanics,
Who hurried the hill breezes, spouting malice
Plangent over meadows, and looked down
On rifts of torn and empty houses
Like old women with teeth unjubilant
That waited faintly, briefly and in vain:

We know, eternal gunman, our flesh remembers
The tensile boughs, the nimble blue plateaus,
The mounted, yielding cities of the air!

That saddled sky that shook down vertical
Repeated play of fireno hypogeum
Of wave or rock was good against one hour.
We did not ask for that, but have survived,
And will persist to speak again before
All stubble streets that have not curved
To memory, or known the ominous lifted arm
That lowers down the arc of Helens brow
To saturate with blessing and dismay.

A goose, tobacco and cologne
Three winged and gold-shod prophecies of heaven,
The lavish heart shall always have to leaven
And spread with bells and voices, and atone
The abating shadows of our conscript dust.

Anchises navel, dripping of the sea,
The hands Erasmus dipped in gleaming tides,
Gathered the voltage of blown blood and vine;
Delve upward for the new and scattered wine,
O brother-thief of time, that we recall.
Laugh out the meager penance of their days
Who dare not share with us the breath released,
The substance drilled and spent beyond repair
For golden, or the shadow of gold hair.

Distinctly praise the years, whose volatile
Blamed bleeding hands extend and thresh the height
The imagination spans beyond despair,
Outpacing bargain, vocable and prayer.",0

"We passed old farmer Boothby in the field.
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes
That never flinched or turned to compromise,
And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,
Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm
In all of Maine could boast of; and away
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...
We walked on leisurely until a bend
Showed him once more, now working toward the end
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.

Then we turned off abruptlytook the road
Cutting the village, the one with the commanding
View of the river. And we strode
More briskly now to the long pier that showed
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped
Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped
More on than in the water. Smoothly then
We shot its nose against the rippling current,
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;
Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....
Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.
And over us the wise and noble-hearted
Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,
And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk
Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,

Motionless in the meadows
The trees, the rocks, the cows...
And quiet dripped from the shadows
Like rain from heavy boughs.

The tree-toads started ringing
Their ceaseless silver bells;
A land-locked breeze came swinging
Its censer of earthy smells.

The rivers tiny canon
Stretched into dusky lands;
Like a dark and silent companion
Evening held out her hands.

Hushed were the dawns bravados;
Loud noon was a silenced cry
And quiet slipped from the shadows
As stars slip out of the sky...

It must have been an hour more, or later,
When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!
There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood
And grinned to see us stare, incredulous
Too startled to remember fear or flight.
Feeling the menace in the crafty night,
We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!
Using our very names he called. We drew
With creaking courage down the avenue
Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,
(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)
Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!
The woods became his background; every tree
Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night
Flowed in and out of him, as though content
With such a native element;
Happy to move about a spirit quite
As old, as placid and as confident...
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad
He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...

We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.",0
"Living, I had no might
To make you hear,
Now, in the inmost night,
I am so near
No whisper, falling light,

Living, I had no claim
On your great hours.
Now the thin candle-flame,
The closing flowers,
Wed summer with my name, 
And these are ours.

Your shadow on the dust,
Strength, and a cry,
Delight, despair, mistrust, 
All these am I.
Dawn, and the far hills thrust
To a far sky.

To stay your tread,
Now all that was my will
Silence has said.

"Momus is the name men give your face,
The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle
Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,
Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.

Yes, Momus,
Men have flung your face in bronze
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.
They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,
Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones
Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.

I wonder, Momus,
Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter
On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.
A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,
You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;
Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,
Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women
Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,
And blood drops of undiminishing war.",0
"Potuia, potuia
White grave goddess,
Pity my sadness,
O silence of Paros.

I am not of these about thy feet,
These garments and decorum;
I am thy brother,
Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,
And thou hearest me not.

I have whispered thee in thy solitudes
Of our loves in Phrygia,
The far ecstasy of burning noons
When the fragile pipes
Ceased in the cypress shade,
And the brown fingers of the shepherd
Moved over slim shoulders;
And only the cicada sang.

I have told thee of the hills
And the lisp of reeds
And the sun upon thy breasts,

And thou hearest me not,
Potuia, potuia

"The ancient songs
Pass deathward mournfully.

Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,
Regretful eyes, and drooping breasts and wings
Symbols of ancient songs
Mournfully passing
Down to the great white surges,
Watched of none - -
Save the frail sea-birds
And the lithe pale girls,
Daughters of Okeanos.

And the songs pass
From the green land
Which lies upon the waves as a leaf
On the flowers of hyacinth;
And they pass from the waters,
The manifold winds and the dim moon,
And they come,
Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,
To the quiet level lands
That she keeps for us all,
That she wrought for us all for sleep
In the silver days of the earth's dawning
Proserpine, daughter of Zeus.

And we turn from the Kuprian's breasts,
And we turn from thee,
Phoibos Apollon,
And we turn from the music of old
And the hills that we loved and the meads,
And we turn from the fiery day,
And the lips that were over-sweet;
For silently
Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,
With purple robe
Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,
Death,
Thou hast come upon us.

And of all the ancient songs
Passing to the swallow-blue halls
By the dark streams of Persephone,
This only remains:
That in the end we turn to thee,
Death,
That we turn to thee, singing
One last song.

O Death,
Thou art an healing wind
That blowest over white flowers
A-tremble with dew;
Thou art a wind flowing
Over long leagues of lonely sea;
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;
Thou art the pale peace of one
Satiate with old desires;
Thou art the silence of beauty,
And we look no more for the morning;
We yearn no more for the sun,
Since with thy white hands,
Death,
Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,
The slim colorless poppies
Which in thy garden alone
Softly thou gatherest.

And silently;
And with slow feet approaching;
And with bowed head and unlit eyes,
We kneel before thee:
And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us
Flowers from thy thin cold hands,
And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,
Thou sealest our eyes
And the illimitable quietude
Comes gently upon us.",0

"She that but little patience knew,
From childhood on, had now so much
A grey gull lost its fear and flew
Down to her cell and there alit,
And there endured her fingers' touch
And from her fingers ate its bit.

Did she in touching that lone wing
Recall the years before her mind
Became a bitter, an abstract thing,
Her thought some popular enmity:
Blind and leader of the blind
Drinking the foul ditch where they lie?

When long ago I saw her ride
Under Ben Bulben to the meet,
The beauty of her country-side
With all youth's lonely wildness stirred,
She seemed to have grown clean and sweet
Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird:

Sea-borne, or balanced in the air
When first it sprang out of the nest
Upon some lofty rock to stare
Upon the cloudy canopy,
While under its storm-beaten breast
Cried out the hollows of the sea.",0
"There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,
And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming
And humming sands, where windy surges wend:
And he called loudly to the stars to bend
From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they
Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend
Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!
The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.
He fled the persecution of her glory
And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.
But naught they heard, for they are always listening,
The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend
Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,
And thought, I will my heavy story tell
Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send
Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;
And my own tale again for me shall sing,
And my own whispering words be comforting,
And lo! my ancient burden may depart.
Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan
Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.",0
"The woods of Arcady are dead,
And over is their antique joy;
Of old the world on dreaming fed;
Grey Truth is now her painted toy;
Yet still she turns her restless head:
But O, sick children of the world,
Of all the many changing things
In dreary dancing past us whirled,
To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,
Words alone are certain good.
Where are now the warring kings,
Word be-mockers? By the Rood
Where are now the warring kings?
An idle word is now their glory,

Reading some entangled story:
The kings of the old time are dead;
The wandering earth herself may be
Only a sudden flaming word,
In clanging space a moment heard,
Troubling the endless reverie.

Then nowise worship dusty deeds,
Nor seek, for this is also sooth,
To hunger fiercely after truth,
Lest all thy toiling only breeds
New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth
Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then,
No learning from the starry men,
Who follow with the optic glass
The whirling ways of stars that pass 
Seek, then, for this is also sooth,
No word of theirs the cold star-bane
Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,
And dead is all their human truth.
Go gather by the humming sea
Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,
And to its lips thy story tell,
And they thy comforters will be,
Rewarding in melodious guile
Thy fretful words a little while,
Till they shall singing fade in ruth
And die a pearly brotherhood;
For words alone are certain good:
Sing, then, for this is also sooth.

I must be gone: there is a grave
Where daffodil and lily wave,
And I would please the hapless faun,
Buried under the sleepy ground,
With mirthful songs before the dawn.
His shouting days with mirth were crowned;
And still I dream he treads the lawn,
Walking ghostly in the dew,
Pierced by my glad singing through,
My songs of old earth's dreamy youth:
But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou!

 Black earth preceded by a tendril? It is to that

Phenomenon
The above formation, 
 Translucent like the atmospherea cortex merely
 That on which darts cannot strike decisively the first

Time, a substance
Needful as an instance
 Of the indestructibility of matter; it 
 Has looked at the electricity and at the earth-

Here; the name means thick. Will
 Depth be depth, thick skin be thick, to one who can see no
 Beautiful element of unreason under it?",0
"Man, looking into the sea
taking the view from those who have as much right to it as you have it to yourself
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing
but you cannot stand in the middle of this:
the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave.
The firs stand in a processioneach with an emerald turkey-foot at the top
reserved as their contours, saying nothing;
repression, however, is not the most obvious characteristic of the sea;
the sea is a collector, quick to return a rapacious look.
There are others besides you who have worn that look
whose expression is no longer a protest; the fish no longer investigate them
for their bones have not lasted;
men lower nets, unconscious of the fact that they are desecrating a grave,
and row quickly awaythe blades of the oars 
moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were no such thing as death.
The wrinkles progress upon themselves in a phalanxbeautiful under networks of foam,
and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the seaweed;
the birds swim through the air at top speed, emitting cat-calls as heretofore
the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion beneath them
and the ocean, under the pulsation of light-houses and noise of bell-buoys,
advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which dropped things are bound to sink
in which if they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor consciousness.",0
"My bands of silk and miniver
Momently grew heavier;
The black gauze was beggarly thin;
The ermine muffled mouth and chin;
I could not suck the moonlight in.

Harlequin in lozenges
Of love and hate, I walked in these
Striped and ragged rigmaroles;
Along the pavement my footsoles
Trod warily on living coals.

Shouldering the thoughts I loathed,
In their corrupt disguises clothed,
Morality I could not tear
From my ribs, to leave them bare
Ivory in silver air.

There I walked, and there I raged;
The spiritual savage caged
Within my skeleton, raged afresh
To feel, behind a carnal mesh,
The clean bones crying in the flesh.",0

When the world turns completely upside down
You say well emigrate to the Eastern Shore
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;
Well live among wild peach trees, miles from town,
Youll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown
Homespun, dyed butternuts dark gold color.
Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,
Well swim in milk and honey till we drown.

The winter will be short, the summer long,
The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;
All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall
Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.

The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.
The misted early mornings will be cold;
The little puddles will be roofed with glass.
The sun, which burns from copper into brass,
Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.

Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;
The spring begins before the winters over.
By February you may find the skins
Of garter snakes and water moccasins
Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.

When April pours the colors of a shell
Upon the hills, when every little creek
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake
In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,
When strawberries go begging, and the sleek
Blue plums lie open to the blackbirds beak,
We shall live well we shall live very well.

The months between the cherries and the peaches
Are brimming cornucopias which spill
Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;
Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches
Well trample bright persimmons, while you kill
Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.

Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones
Theres something in this richness that I hate.
I love the look, austere, immaculate,
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.
Theres something in my very blood that owns
Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,
A thread of water, churned to milky spate
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.

I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,
Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves;
That spring, briefer than apple-blossoms breath,
Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,
Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,
And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death.",0
"Perspective never withers from their eyes; 
They keep that docile edict of the Spring
That blends March with August Antarctic skies: 
These are but cows that see no other thing 
Than grass and snow, and their own inner being 
Through the rich halo that they do not trouble 
Even to cast upon the seasons fleeting
Though they should thin and die on last years stubble.

And they are awkward, ponderous and uncoy . . . 
While we who press the cider mill, regarding them
We, who with pledges taste the bright annoy 
Of friendships acid wine, retarding phlegm,
Shifting reprisals (til who shall tell us when
The jest is too sharp to be kindly?) boast
Much of our store of faith in other men
Who would, ourselves, stalk down the merriest ghost.

Through mapled vistas, cancelled reservations!

High from the central cupola, they say
Ones glance could cross the borders of three states; 
But I have seen deaths stare in slow survey 
From four horizons that no one relates . . .

Here three hours from the semaphores, the Czars
Of golf, by twos and threes in plaid plusfours 
Alight with sticks abristle and cigars.

To the persuasive suburban land agent
In bootleg roadhouses where the gin fizz
Bubbles in time to Hollywoods new love-nest pageant. 
Fresh from the radio in the old Meeting House 
(Now the New Avalon Hotel) volcanoes roar
A welcome to highsteppers that no mouse

The spinster polish of antiquity . . . 
Who holds the lease on time and on disgrace? 
What eats the pattern with ubiquity?
Where are my kinsmen and the patriarch race?

The resigned factions of the dead preside. 
Dead rangers bled their comfort on the snow; 
But I must ask slain Iroquois to guide
Me farther than scalped Yankees knew to go: 
Shoulder the curse of sundered parentage, 
Wait for the postman driving from Birch Hill

Ariseyes, take this sheaf of dust upon your tongue!
In one last angelus lift throbbing throat
Listen, transmuting silence with that stilly note

Of pain that Emily, that Isadora knew!
While high from dim elm-chancels hung with dew,
That triple-noted clause of moonlight

Breaks us and saves, yes, breaks the heart, yet yields

"While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:
Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.
At fourteen I married My Lord you.
I never laughed, being bashful.
Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.

At fifteen I stopped scowling,
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours
Forever and forever, and forever.
Why should I climb the look out?

At sixteen you departed
You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,
And you have been gone five months.
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.

You dragged your feet when you went out.
By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,
Too deep to clear them away!
The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August
Over the grass in the West garden;
They hurt me.
I grow older.

Please let me know beforehand,
And I will come out to meet you

This body I tended, wept with and enjoyed;
Since there is no escape even for me

The scent of orchards in the rain, the sea
And hours alone too still and sure for prayer
Since darkness waits for me, then all the more
Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore
In pride, and let me sing with my last breath;
In these few hours of light I lift my head;
Life is my loverI shall leave the dead

When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,

 When the first bird sings and the first bud opes, 
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals
I know what the caged bird feels!

I know why the caged bird beats his wing
 Till its blood is red on the cruel bars; 
For he must fly back to his perch and cling 
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
 And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars 
And they pulse again with a keener sting
I know why he beats his wing!

I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
 When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,
When he beats his bars and he would be free;
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
 But a prayer that he sends from his hearts deep core, 
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings

For mine own bosom is the paradise
Where all my lifes fair visions are unfurled.

Unmindful of the changing outer skies,
Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.
I heed them not; or if the subtle night
Haunt me with deities I never saw,
I soon mine eyelids drowsy curtain draw
To hide their myriad faces from my sight.
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe
A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw.",0

Among twenty snowy mountains, 
The only moving thing 
Was the eye of the blackbird. 


I was of three minds, 
Like a tree 
In which there are three blackbirds. 


The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds. 
It was a small part of the pantomime. 


A man and a woman 
Are one. 
A man and a woman and a blackbird 
Are one. 


I do not know which to prefer, 
The beauty of inflections 
Or the beauty of innuendoes, 
The blackbird whistling 
Or just after. 


Icicles filled the long window 
With barbaric glass. 
The shadow of the blackbird 
Crossed it, to and fro. 
The mood 
Traced in the shadow 
An indecipherable cause. 


O thin men of Haddam, 
Why do you imagine golden birds? 
Do you not see how the blackbird 
Walks around the feet 
Of the women about you? 


I know noble accents 
And lucid, inescapable rhythms; 
But I know, too, 
That the blackbird is involved 
In what I know. 


When the blackbird flew out of sight, 
It marked the edge 
Of one of many circles. 


At the sight of blackbirds 
Flying in a green light, 
Even the bawds of euphony 
Would cry out sharply. 


He rode over Connecticut 
In a glass coach. 
Once, a fear pierced him, 
In that he mistook 
The shadow of his equipage 
For blackbirds. 


The river is moving. 
The blackbird must be flying. 


It was evening all afternoon. 
It was snowing 
And it was going to snow. 
The blackbird sat 
In the cedar-limbs.",0

Calm was the sea to which your course you kept,
Oh, how much calmer than all southern seas!
Many your nameless mates, whom the keen breeze
Wafted from mothers that of old have wept.
All souls of children taken as they slept
Are your companions, partners of your ease,
And the green souls of all these autumn trees
Are with you through the silent spaces swept.
Your virgin body gave its gentle breath
Untainted to the gods. Why should we grieve,
But that we merit not your holy death?
We shall not loiter long, your friends and I;
Living you made it goodlier to live,
Dead you will make it easier to die.

II

With you a part of me hath passed away;
For in the peopled forest of my mind
A tree made leafless by this wintry wind
Shall never don again its green array.
Chapel and fireside, country road and bay,
Have something of their friendliness resigned;
Another, if I would, I could not find,
And I am grown much older in a day.
But yet I treasure in my memory
Your gift of charity, your mellow ease,
And the dear honour of your amity;
For these once mine, my life is rich with these.
And I scarce know which part may greater be,
What I keep of you, or you rob of me.

III

Your bark lies anchored in the peaceful bight
Until a kinder wind unfurl her sail;
Your docile spirit, winged by this gale,
Hath at the dawning fled into the light.
And I half know why heaven deemed it right
Your youth, and this my joy in youth, should fail;
God hath them still, for ever they avail,
Eternity hath borrowed that delight.
For long ago I taught my thoughts to run
Where all the great things live that lived of yore,
And in eternal quiet float and soar;
There all my loves are gathered into one,
Where change is not, nor parting any more,
Nor revolution of the moon and sun.

IV

In my deep heart these chimes would still have rung
To toll your passing, had you not been dead;
For time a sadder mask than death may spread
Over the face that ever should be young.
The bough that falls with all its trophies hung
Falls not too soon, but lays its flower-crowned head
Most royal in the dust, with no leaf shed
Unhallowed or unchiselled or unsung.
And though the after world will never hear
The happy name of one so gently true,
Nor chronicles write large this fatal year,
Yet we who loved you, though we be but few,
Keep you in whatsoeer is good, and rear
In our weak virtues monuments to you.",0
"But then there comes that moment rare
When, for no cause that I can find,
The little voices of the air
Sound above all the sea and wind.

The sea and wind do then obey
And sighing, sighing double notes
Of double basses, content to play
A droning chord for the little throats

The little throats that sing and rise
Up into the light with lovely ease
And a kind of magical, sweet surprise
To hear and know themselves for these

For these little voices: the bee, the fly,
The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks,
The breeze on the grass-tops bending by,
The shrill quick sound that the insect makes.",0
"Even iron can put forth,
Even iron.

This is the iron age,
But let us take heart
Seeing iron break and bud,
Seeing rusty iron puff with clouds of blossom.

The almond-tree,
December's bare iron hooks sticking out of earth.

The almond-tree,
That knows the deadliest poison, like a snake
In supreme bitterness.

Upon the iron, and upon the steel,
Odd flakes as if of snow, odd bits of snow,
Odd crumbs of melting snow.

But you mistake, it is not from the sky;
From out the iron, and from out the steel,
Flying not down from heaven, but storming up,
Strange storming up from the dense under-earth
Along the iron, to the living steel
In rose-hot tips, and flakes of rose-pale snow
Setting supreme annunciation to the world.

Nay, what a heart of delicate super-faith,
Iron-breaking,
The rusty swords of almond-trees.

Trees suffer, like races, down the long ages.
They wander and are exiled, they live in exile through long ages
Like drawn blades never sheathed, hacked and gone black,
The alien trees in alien lands: and yet
The heart of blossom,
The unquenchable heart of blossom!

Look at the many-cicatrised frail vine, none more scarred and frail,
Yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon
From the small wound-stump.

Even the wilful, obstinate, gummy fig-tree
Can be kept down, but he'll burst like a polyp into prolixity.

And the almond-tree, in exile, in the iron age!

This is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked, amphoras, craters, cantharus, oenochoe, and open-hearted cylix,
Bristling now with the iron of almond-trees

Iron, but unforgotten,
Iron, dawn-hearted,
Ever-beating dawn-heart, enveloped in iron against the exile, against the ages.

See it come forth in blossom
From the snow-remembering heart
In long-nighted January,
In the long dark nights of the evening star, and Sirius, and the Etna snow-wind through the long night.

Sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted Gethsemane
Into blossom, into pride, into honey-triumph, into most exquisite splendour.
Oh, give me the tree of life in blossom
And the Cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers!

Something must be reassuring to the almond, in the evening star, and the snow-wind, and the long, long, nights,
Some memory of far, sun-gentler lands,
So that the faith in his heart smiles again
And his blood ripples with that untenable delight of once-more-vindicated faith,
And the Gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds, unfolds,
Pearls itself into tenderness of bud
And in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth, steps out in one stride
A naked tree of blossom, like a bridegroom bathing in dew, divested of cover,
Frail-naked, utterly uncovered
To the green night-baying of the dog-star, Etna's snow-edged wind
And January's loud-seeming sun.

Think of it, from the iron fastness
Suddenly to dare to come out naked, in perfection of blossom, beyond the sword-rust.
Think, to stand there in full-unfolded nudity, smiling,
With all the snow-wind, and the sun-glare, and the dog-star baying epithalamion.

Oh, honey-bodied beautiful one,
Come forth from iron,
Red your heart is.
Fragile-tender, fragile-tender life-body,
More fearless than iron all the time,
And so much prouder, so disdainful of reluctances.

In the distance like hoar-frost, like silvery ghosts communing on a green hill,
Hoar-frost-like and mysterious.

In the garden raying out
With a body like spray, dawn-tender, and looking about
With such insuperable, subtly-smiling assurance,
Sword-blade-born.

Unpromised,
No bounds being set.
Flaked out and come unpromised,
The tree being life-divine,
Fearing nothing, life-blissful at the core
Within iron and earth.

Knots of pink, fish-silvery
In heaven, in blue, blue heaven,
Soundless, bliss-full, wide-rayed, honey-bodied,
Red at the core,
Red at the core,
Knotted in heaven upon the fine light.

Open,
Open,
Five times wide open,
Six times wide open,
And given, and perfect;
And red at the core with the last sore-heartedness,
Sore-hearted-looking.",0
"At evening, sitting on this terrace,
When the sun from the west, beyond Pisa, beyond the mountains of Carrara
Departs, and the world is taken by surprise ...

When the tired flower of Florence is in gloom beneath the glowing
Brown hills surrounding ...

When under the arches of the Ponte Vecchio
A green light enters against stream, flush from the west,
Against the current of obscure Arno ...

Look up, and you see things flying
Between the day and the night;
Swallows with spools of dark thread sewing the shadows together.

A circle swoop, and a quick parabola under the bridge arches
Where light pushes through;
A sudden turning upon itself of a thing in the air.
A dip to the water.

And you think:
""The swallows are flying so late!""

Swallows?

Dark air-life looping
Yet missing the pure loop ...
A twitch, a twitter, an elastic shudder in flight
And serrated wings against the sky,
Like a glove, a black glove thrown up at the light,
And falling back.

Never swallows!
Bats!
The swallows are gone.

At a wavering instant the swallows gave way to bats
By the Ponte Vecchio ...
Changing guard.

Bats, and an uneasy creeping in one's scalp
As the bats swoop overhead!
Flying madly.

Pipistrello!
Black piper on an infinitesimal pipe.
Little lumps that fly in air and have voices indefinite, wildly vindictive;

Wings like bits of umbrella.

Bats!

Creatures that hang themselves up like an old rag, to sleep;
And disgustingly upside down.

Hanging upside down like rows of disgusting old rags
And grinning in their sleep.
Bats!

In China the bat is symbol for happiness.

The bronze General Grant riding a bronze horse in Lincoln Park
Shrivels in the sun by day when the motor cars whirr by in long processions going somewhere to keep apppointment for dinner and matinees and buying and selling
Though in the dusk and nightfall when high waves are piling
On the slabs of the promenade along the lake shore near by
 I have seen the general dare the combers come closer
And make to ride his bronze horse out into the hoofs and guns of the storm.

Lincoln in bronze stands among the white lines of snow, his bronze forehead meeting soft echoes of the newsies crying forty thousand men are dead along the Yser, his bronze ears listening to the mumbled roar of the city at his bronze feet.
A lithe Indian on a bronze pony, Shakespeare seated with long legs in bronze, Garibaldi in a bronze cape, they hold places in the cold, lonely snow to-night on their pedestals and so they will hold them past midnight and into the dawn.",0

Where bodies are drawn into grass
That feeds no flocks, and into evergreens
That bear no fruit 
There where along the shaded walks
Vain sighs are heard,
And vainer dreams are dreamed
Of close communion with departed souls 
But here under the apple tree
I loved and watched and pruned
With gnarled hands
In the long, long years;

To move in the chemic change and circle of life,
Into the soil and into the flesh of the tree,

"What large, dark hands are those at the window
Lifted, grasping the golden light
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves
 To my heart's delight?

Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,
In the west I see a redness come
Over the evening's burning breast 
 'Tis the wound of love goes home!

The woodbine creeps abroad
Calling low to her lover:
The sun-lit flirt who all the day
Has poised above her lips in play
And stolen kisses, shallow and gay
Of pollen, now has gone away
 She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,
And when above her his broad wings hover
Then her bright breast she will uncover
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.

Into the yellow, evening glow
Saunters a man from the farm below,
Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.
The bird lies warm against the wall.
She glances quick her startled eyes
Towards him, then she turns away
Her small head, making warm display
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway
Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies
In one blue stoop from out the sties
Into the evening's empty hall.

Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes
Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,
Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.

The rabbit presses back her ears,
Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes
And crouches low: then with wild spring
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming
To be choked back, the wire ring
Her frantic effort throttling:
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!

Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes
And ready to open in brown surprise
Should I not answer to his talk
Or should he my tears surmise.

I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair
Watching the door open: he flashes bare
His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board
And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword
Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud
His coming: he raises up my face to him
And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim
Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!
I know not what fine wire is round my throat,
I only know I let him finger there
My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood
Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood
Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown
Within him, die, and find death good.",0
"See, the grass is full of stars,
Fallen in their brightness;
Hearts they have of shining gold,
Rays of shining whiteness.

Buttercups have honeyed hearts,
Bees they love the clover,
But I love the daisies' dance
All the meadow over.

Blow, O blow, you happy winds,
Singing summer's praises,
Up the field and down the field
A-dancing with the daisies.",0
"This spring as it comes bursts up in bonfires green,
Wild puffing of emerald trees, and flame-filled bushes,
Thorn-blossom lifting in wreaths of smoke between
Where the wood fumes up and the watery, flickering rushes.

I am amazed at this spring, this conflagration
Of green fires lit on the soil of the earth, this blaze
Of growing, and sparks that puff in wild gyration,
Faces of people streaming across my gaze.

And I, what fountain of fire am I among
This leaping combustion of spring? My spirit is tossed
About like a shadow buffeted in the throng
Of flames, a shadow that's gone astray, and is lost.",0
"I never knew the earth had so much gold
The fields run over with it, and this hill
Hoary and old,
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.

Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good
This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!
This fringe of wood,
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.

You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see
Your face grow mystical, as on that night
You turned to me,
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.

Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;
The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .
And you become
A goddess standing in a world of fire!",0
"The fog comes
on little cat feet.

It sits looking
over harbor and city
on silent haunches
and then moves on.",0
"When she rises in the morning
I linger to watch her;
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window
And the sunbeams catch her
Glistening white on the shoulders,
While down her sides the mellow
Golden shadow glows as
She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts
Sway like full-blown yellow
Gloire de Dijon roses.

She drips herself with water, and her shoulders
Glisten as silver, they crumple up
Like wet and falling roses, and I listen
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.
In the window full of sunlight
Concentrates her golden shadow
Fold on fold, until it glows as
Mellow as the glory roses.",0
"Pray why are you so bare, so bare,
 Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;
And why, when I go through the shade you throw,
 Runs a shudder over me?

My leaves were green as the best, I trow,
 And sap ran free in my veins,
But I say in the moonlight dim and weird
 A guiltless victim's pains.

I bent me down to hear his sigh;
 I shook with his gurgling moan,
And I trembled sore when they rode away,
 And left him here alone.

They'd charged him with the old, old crime,
 And set him fast in jail:
Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,
 And why does the night wind wail?

He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,
 And he raised his hand to the sky;
But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,
 And the steady tread drew nigh.

Who is it rides by night, by night,
 Over the moonlit road?
And what is the spur that keeps the pace,
 What is the galling goad?

And now they beat at the prison door,
 ""Ho, keeper, do not stay!
We are friends of him whom you hold within,
 And we fain would take him away

""From those who ride fast on our heels
 With mind to do him wrong;
They have no care for his innocence,
 And the rope they bear is long.""

They have fooled the jailer with lying words,
 They have fooled the man with lies;
The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,
 And the great door open flies.

Now they have taken him from the jail,
 And hard and fast they ride,
And the leader laughs low down in his throat,
 As they halt my trunk beside.

Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,
 And the doctor one of white,
And the minister, with his oldest son,
 Was curiously bedight.

Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?
 'Tis but a little space,
And the time will come when these shall dread
 The mem'ry of your face.

I feel the rope against my bark,
 And the weight of him in my grain,
I feel in the throe of his final woe
 The touch of my own last pain.

And never more shall leaves come forth
 On the bough that bears the ban;
I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,
 From the curse of a guiltless man.

And ever the judge rides by, rides by,
 And goes to hunt the deer,
And ever another rides his soul
 In the guise of a mortal fear.

And ever the man he rides me hard,
 And never a night stays he;
For I feel his curse as a haunted bough,
 On the trunk of a haunted tree.",0
"When I am dead and over me bright April
Shakes out her rain-drenched hair,
Tho' you should lean above me broken-hearted,
I shall not care.

I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful
When rain bends down the bough,
And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted
Than you are now.",0

And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
There midnights all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,
And evening full of the linnets wings.

I will arise and go now, for always night and day
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,
I hear it in the deep hearts core.",0

"We passed old farmer Boothby in the field.
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes
That never flinched or turned to compromise,
And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,
Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm
In all of Maine could boast of; and away
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...
We walked on leisurely until a bend
Showed him once more, now working toward the end
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.

Then we turned off abruptlytook the road
Cutting the village, the one with the commanding
View of the river. And we strode
More briskly now to the long pier that showed
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped
Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped
More on than in the water. Smoothly then
We shot its nose against the rippling current,
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;
Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....
Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.
And over us the wise and noble-hearted
Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,
And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk
Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,

Motionless in the meadows
The trees, the rocks, the cows...
And quiet dripped from the shadows
Like rain from heavy boughs.

The tree-toads started ringing
Their ceaseless silver bells;
A land-locked breeze came swinging
Its censer of earthy smells.

The rivers tiny canon
Stretched into dusky lands;
Like a dark and silent companion
Evening held out her hands.

Hushed were the dawns bravados;
Loud noon was a silenced cry
And quiet slipped from the shadows
As stars slip out of the sky...

It must have been an hour more, or later,
When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!
There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood
And grinned to see us stare, incredulous
Too startled to remember fear or flight.
Feeling the menace in the crafty night,
We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!
Using our very names he called. We drew
With creaking courage down the avenue
Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,
(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)
Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!
The woods became his background; every tree
Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night
Flowed in and out of him, as though content
With such a native element;
Happy to move about a spirit quite
As old, as placid and as confident...
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad
He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...

We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.",0
"Moonmoth and grasshopper that flee our page
And still wing on, untarnished of the name
We pinion to your bodies to assuage
Our envy of your freedomwe must maim

Because we are usurpers, and chagrined
And take the wing and scar it in the hand.
Names we have, even, to clap on the wind;
But we must die, as you, to understand.

I dreamed that all men dropped their names, and sang
As only they can praise, who build their days
With fin and hoof, with wing and sweetened fang
Struck free and holy in one Name always.",0
"She has no need to fear the fall
Of harvest from the laddered reach
Of orchards, nor the tide gone ebbing
 From the steep beach.

Nor hold to pain's effrontery
Her body's bulwark, stern and savage,
Nor be a glass, where to forsee
 Another's ravage.

What she has gathered, and what lost,
She will not find to lose again.
She is possessed by time, who once
 Was loved by men.",0
"I
The winter evening settles down
With smell of steaks in passageways.
Six oclock.
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
And now a gusty shower wraps
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers from vacant lots;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.

And then the lighting of the lamps.

II
The morning comes to consciousness
Of faint stale smells of beer
From the sawdust-trampled street
With all its muddy feet that press
To early coffee-stands.
With the other masquerades
That time resumes,
One thinks of all the hands
That are raising dingy shades
In a thousand furnished rooms.

III
You tossed a blanket from the bed,
You lay upon your back, and waited;
You dozed, and watched the night revealing
The thousand sordid images
Of which your soul was constituted;
They flickered against the ceiling.
And when all the world came back
And the light crept up between the shutters
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,
You had such a vision of the street
As the street hardly understands;
Sitting along the beds edge, where
You curled the papers from your hair,
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
In the palms of both soiled hands.

IV
His soul stretched tight across the skies
That fade behind a city block,
Or trampled by insistent feet
At four and five and six oclock;
And short square fingers stuffing pipes,
And evening newspapers, and eyes
Assured of certain certainties,
The conscience of a blackened street
Impatient to assume the world.

I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images, and cling:
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing.

Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;
The worlds revolve like ancient women
Gathering fuel in vacant lots.",0
"The willows carried a slow sound,
A sarabande the wind mowed on the mead.
I could never remember
That seething, steady leveling of the marshes
Till age had brought me to the sea.

Flags, weeds. And remembrance of steep alcoves
Where cypresses shared the noons
Tyranny; they drew me into hades almost.
And mammoth turtles climbing sulphur dreams
Yielded, while sun-silt rippled them
Asunder ...

How much I would have bartered! the black gorge
And all the singular nestings in the hills
Where beavers learn stitch and tooth.
The pond I entered once and quickly fled
I remember now its singing willow rim.

And finally, in that memory all things nurse;
After the city that I finally passed
With scalding unguents spread and smoking darts
The monsoon cut across the delta
At gulf gates ... There, beyond the dykes

I heard wind flaking sapphire, like this summer,
And willows could not hold more steady sound.",0
"Twelve o'clock.
Along the reaches of the street
Held in a lunar synthesis,
Whispering lunar incantations
Dissolve the floors of memory
And all its clear relations,
Its divisions and precisions,
Every street lamp that I pass
Beats like a fatalistic drum,
And through the spaces of the dark
Midnight shakes the memory
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.

Half-past one,
The street lamp sputtered,
The street lamp muttered,
The street lamp said, ""Regard that woman
Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door
Which opens on her like a grin.
You see the border of her dress
Is torn and stained with sand,
And you see the corner of her eye
Twists like a crooked pin.""

The memory throws up high and dry
A crowd of twisted things;
A twisted branch upon the beach
Eaten smooth, and polished
As if the world gave up
The secret of its skeleton,
Stiff and white.
A broken spring in a factory yard,
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
Hard and curled and ready to snap.

Half-past two,
The street lamp said,
""Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
Slips out its tongue
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.""
So the hand of a child, automatic,
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.
I could see nothing behind that child's eye.
I have seen eyes in the street
Trying to peer through lighted shutters,
And a crab one afternoon in a pool,
An old crab with barnacles on his back,
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.

Half-past three,
The lamp sputtered,
The lamp muttered in the dark.

The lamp hummed:
""Regard the moon,
La lune ne garde aucune rancune,
She winks a feeble eye,
She smiles into corners.
She smoothes the hair of the grass.
The moon has lost her memory.
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,
Her hand twists a paper rose,
That smells of dust and old Cologne,
She is alone
With all the old nocturnal smells
That cross and cross across her brain.""
The reminiscence comes
Of sunless dry geraniums
And dust in crevices,
Smells of chestnuts in the streets,
And female smells in shuttered rooms,
And cigarettes in corridors
And cocktail smells in bars.""

The lamp said,
""Four o'clock,
Here is the number on the door.
Memory!
You have the key,
The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
Mount.
The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,
Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.""

The last twist of the knife.",0
"Out of the winds' and the waves' riot,
Out of the loud foam,
He has put in to a great quiet
And a still home.

Here he may lie at ease and wonder
Why the old ship waits,
And hark for the surge and the strong thunder
Of the full Straits,

And look for the fishing fleet at morning,
Shadows like lost souls,
Slide through the fog where the seal's warning
Betrays the shoals,

And watch for the deep-sea liner climbing
Out of the bright West,
With a salmon-sky and her wake shining
Like a tern's breast, 

And never know he is done for ever
With the old sea's pride,
Borne from the fight and the full endeavour
On an ebb tide.",0
"Maurice, weep not, I am not here under this pine tree.
The balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass,
The stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls,
But thou grievest, while my soul lies rapturous
In the blest Nirvana of eternal light!
Go to the good heart that is my husband,
Who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i
Tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him
Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh
I won spirit, and through spirit, peace.
There is no marriage in heaven,
But there is love.",0

Castles and towers;

The rye and the corn,
Lo, they were bond to Sleep
Ere they were born.

Yea, though the blind earth sows
For the fruit and the sheaf,
They shall harvest the leaf of the rose
And the dust of the leaf.

Pride of the sword and power
Are theirs at their need
Who shall rule but the root of the flower
The fall of the seed.

They who follow the flesh
In splendour and tears,
They shall rest and clothe them afresh
In the fulness of years.

From the dream of the dust they came
As the dawn set free.
They shall pass as the flower of the flame
Or the foam of the sea.

The earth builds on the earth
Castles and towers.
The earth saith of the earth:
All shall be ours.",0
"May I for my own self song's truth reckon,
Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days
Hardship endured oft.
Bitter breast-cares have I abided,
Known on my keel many a care's hold,
And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head
While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,
My feet were by frost benumbed.
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs
Hew my heart round and hunger begot
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not
That he on dry land loveliest liveth,
List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,
Weathered the winter, wretched outcast
Deprived of my kinsmen;
Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,
There I heard naught save the harsh sea
And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,
Did for my games the gannet's clamour,
Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.
Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed
With spray on his pinion.
Not any protector
May make merry man faring needy.
This he little believes, who aye in winsome life
Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business,
Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft
Must bide above brine.
Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,
Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now
The heart's thought that I on high streams
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.
Moaneth alway my mind's lust
That I fare forth, that I afar hence
Seek out a foreign fastness.
For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,
Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;
Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare
Whatever his lord will.
He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having
Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight
Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.
Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,
Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,
All this admonisheth man eager of mood,
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks
On flood-ways to be far departing.
Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,
He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not 
He the prosperous man what some perform
Where wandering them widest draweth.
So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,
My mood 'mid the mere-flood,
Over the whale's acre, would wander wide.
On earth's shelter cometh oft to me,
Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,
Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow
My lord deems to me this dead life
On loan and on land, I believe not
That any earth-weal eternal standeth
Save there be somewhat calamitous
That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain.
Disease or oldness or sword-hate
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.
And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after 
Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,
That he will work ere he pass onward,
Frame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice,
Daring ado, ...
So that all men shall honour him after
And his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English,
Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,
Delight mid the doughty.
Days little durable,
And all arrogance of earthen riches,
There come now no kings nor Csars
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.
Howe'er in mirth most magnified,
Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest,
Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!
Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.
No man at all going the earth's gait,
But age fares against him, his face paleth,
Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,
Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven,
Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,
Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,
Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,
And though he strew the grave with gold,
His born brothers, their buried bodies
Be an unlikely treasure hoard.",0
"Out in the sky the great dark clouds are massing;
I look far out into the pregnant night,
Where I can hear a solemn booming gun
And catch the gleaming of a random light,
That tells me that the ship I seek is passing, passing.

My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;
For I would hail and check that ship of ships.
I stretch my hands imploring, cry aloud,
My voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips,
And but its ghost doth reach that vessel, passing, passing.

O Earth, O Sky, O Ocean, both surpassing,
O heart of mine, O soul that dreads the dark!

When dusk is fallen
Children join hands
And circle round me
Singing ghost songs
And love to the harvest moon;
I am a jack-o'-lantern
With terrible teeth
And the children know
I am fooling.",0
"Green miles of leafy peace are spread
Over these ranks, unseen and serried;
Screening the trenches with their dead
And living men already buried.
The rains beat down, the torrents flow
Into each cold and huddling cave;
And over them the beet-fields grow,
A fortress gentle as a grave.

Morose, impatient, sick at heart,
With rasping nerves and twitching muscles,
We cannot even sleep; we start
With every twig that snaps or rustles.
Sought always by an unseen foe
Over our heads the bullets fly;
But more than these, we fear the snow,
The silent shrapnel of the sky.

Yonder our colonel stalks and grieves,
Meeting the storm with thoughts more stormy;
But we, we sit and watch the leaves
Fall down, a torn and crumpled army.
We mourn for every leaf that lies,
As though it were a comrade slain;
Each was a shelter from the eyes
Of every prying aeroplane. . . 

And in its cloudy uniform,
Stilling the cannons earthly thunder,
The huge artillery of the storm
Plows through the land and pulls it under.
The rain beats down, until the slow
And slipping earth resists no more. . .
And over them the beets will grow
Ranker and redder than before.",0

The quick sparks on the gorse bushes are leaping,
Little jets of sunlight-texture imitating flame;
Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:
They are lords of the desolate wastes of sadness their screamings proclaim.

Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie
Low-rounded on the mournful grass they have bitten down to the quick.
Are they asleep? Are they alive? Now see, when I
Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick.

The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;
There the lazy streamlet pushes
Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes.

Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,
Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow,
Naked on the steep, soft lip
Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.

What if the gorse flowers shrivelled and kissing were lost?
Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds and the songs of the brook!
If my veins and my breasts with love embossed
Withered, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers that the hot wind took.

So my soul like a passionate woman turns,
Filled with remorseful terror to the man she scorned, and her love
For myself in my own eyes' laughter burns,
Runs ecstatic over the pliant folds rippling down to my belly from the breast-lights above.

Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air,
Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.
And the soul of the wind and my blood compare
Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in liberty, drifts on and is sad.

Oh but the water loves me and folds me,
Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as though it were living blood,
Blood of a heaving woman who holds me,
Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely good.

The quick sparks on the gorse-bushes are leaping
Little jets of sunlight texture imitating flame;
Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:
They have triumphed again o'er the ages, their screamings proclaim.

Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie
Low-rounded on the mournful turf they have bitten down to the quick.
Are they asleep? are they living? Now see, when I
Lift my arms, the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick!

The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;
There the lazy streamlet pushes
His bent course mildly; here wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes

Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,
Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow;
Naked on the steep, soft lip
Of the turf I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.

What if the gorse-flowers shrivelled, and I were gone?
What if the waters ceased, where were the marigolds then, and the gudgeon?
What is this thing that I look down upon?
White on the water wimples my shadow, strains like a dog on a string, to run on.

How it looks back, like a white dog to its master!
I on the bank all substance, my shadow all shadow looking up to me, looking back!
And the water runs, and runs faster, runs faster,
And the white dog dances and quivers, I am holding his cord quite slack.

But how splendid it is to be substance, here!
My shadow is neither here nor there; but I, I am royally here!
I am here! I am here! screams the peewit; the may-blobs burst out in a laugh as they hear!
Here! flick the rabbits. Here! pants the gorse. Here! say the insects far and near.

Over my skin in the sunshine, the warm, clinging air
Flushed with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.
You are here! You are here! We have found you! Everywhere
We sought you substantial, you touchstone of caresses, you naked lad!

Oh but the water loves me and folds me,
Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me, murmurs: Oh marvellous stuff!
No longer shadow! and it holds me
Close, and it rolls me, enfolds me, touches me, as if never it could touch me enough.

Sun, but in substance, yellow water-blobs!
Wings and feathers on the crying, mysterious ages, peewits wheeling!
All that is right, all that is good; all that is God takes substance! a rabbit lobs
In confirmation, I hear sevenfold lark-songs pealing.",0
"The trees are in their autumn beauty,
The woodland paths are dry,
Under the October twilight the water
Mirrors a still sky;
Upon the brimming water among the stones
Are nine-and-fifty swans.

The nineteenth autumn has come upon me
Since I first made my count;
I saw, before I had well finished,
All suddenly mount
And scatter wheeling in great broken rings
Upon their clamorous wings.

I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,
And now my heart is sore.
All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,
The first time on this shore,
The bell-beat of their wings above my head,
Trod with a lighter tread.

Unwearied still, lover by lover,
They paddle in the cold
Companionable streams or climb the air;
Their hearts have not grown old;
Passion or conquest, wander where they will,
Attend upon them still.

But now they drift on the still water,
Mysterious, beautiful;
Among what rushes will they build,
By what lake's edge or pool
Delight men's eyes when I awake some day
To find they have flown away?",0
"Give me hunger,
O you gods that sit and give
The world its orders.
Give me hunger, pain and want,
Shut me out with shame and failure
From your doors of gold and fame,
Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!

But leave me a little love,
A voice to speak to me in the day end,
A hand to touch me in the dark room
Breaking the long loneliness.
In the dusk of day-shapes
Blurring the sunset,
One little wandering, western star
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.
Let me go to the window,
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk
And wait and know the coming
Of a little love.",0
"Passing through huddled and ugly walls,
By doorways where women haggard
Looked from their hunger-deep eyes,
Haunted with shadows of hunger-hands,
Out from the huddled and ugly walls,
I came sudden, at the city's edge,
On a blue burst of lake,
Long lake waves breaking under the sun
On a spray-flung curve of shore;
And a fluttering storm of gulls,
Masses of great gray wings
And flying white bellies
Veering and wheeling free in the open.",0
"Desolate and lone
All night long on the lake
Where fog trails and mist creeps,
The whistle of a boat
Calls and cries unendingly,
Like some lost child
In tears and trouble
Hunting the harbor's breast
And the harbor's eyes.",0
"Momus is the name men give your face,
The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle
Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,
Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.

Yes, Momus,
Men have flung your face in bronze
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.
They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,
Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones
Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.

I wonder, Momus,
Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter
On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.
A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,
You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;
Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,
Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women
Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,
And blood drops of undiminishing war.",0
"I shall foot it
Down the roadway in the dusk,
Where shapes of hunger wander
And the fugitives of pain go by.

I shall foot it
In the silence of the morning,
See the night slur into dawn,
Hear the slow great winds arise
Where tall trees flank the way
And shoulder toward the sky.

The broken boulders by the road
Shall not commemorate my ruin.
Regret shall be the gravel under foot.
I shall watch for
Slim birds swift of wing
That go where wind and ranks of thunder
Drive the wild processionals of rain.

The dust of the travelled road
Shall touch my hands and face.",0
"I have sat here happy in the gardens,
Watching the still pool and the reeds
And the dark clouds
Which the wind of the upper air
Tore like the green leafy boughs
Of the divers-hued trees of late summer;
But though I greatly delight
In these and the water-lilies,
That which sets me nighest to weeping
Is the rose and white color of the smooth flag-stones,
And the pale yellow grasses
Among them.",0

Pity my sadness,
O silence of Paros.

These garments and decorum;
I am thy brother,
Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,
And thou hearest me not.

I have whispered thee in thy solitudes
Of our loves in Phrygia,
The far ecstasy of burning noons
When the fragile pipes
Ceased in the cypress shade,
And the brown fingers of the shepherd
Moved over slim shoulders;
And only the cicada sang.

I have told thee of the hills
And the lisp of reeds
And the sun upon thy breasts,

And thou hearest me not,
Potuia, potuia
Thou hearest me not.",0
"The ancient songs
Pass deathward mournfully.

Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,
Regretful eyes, and drooping breasts and wings
Symbols of ancient songs
Mournfully passing
Down to the great white surges,
Watched of none - -
Save the frail sea-birds
And the lithe pale girls,
Daughters of Okeanos.

From the green land
Which lies upon the waves as a leaf
On the flowers of hyacinth;
And they pass from the waters,
The manifold winds and the dim moon,
And they come,
Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,
To the quiet level lands

That she wrought for us all for sleep
In the silver days of the earth's dawning

And we turn from thee,
Phoibos Apollon,
And we turn from the music of old

And we turn from the fiery day,
And the lips that were over-sweet;
For silently
Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,
With purple robe
Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,
Death,
Thou hast come upon us.

And of all the ancient songs
Passing to the swallow-blue halls
By the dark streams of Persephone,
This only remains:
That in the end we turn to thee,
Death,
That we turn to thee, singing
One last song.

O Death,
Thou art an healing wind
That blowest over white flowers
A-tremble with dew;
Thou art a wind flowing
Over long leagues of lonely sea;
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;
Thou art the pale peace of one
Satiate with old desires;
Thou art the silence of beauty,
And we look no more for the morning;
We yearn no more for the sun,
Since with thy white hands,
Death,
Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,
The slim colorless poppies
Which in thy garden alone
Softly thou gatherest.

And silently;
And with slow feet approaching;
And with bowed head and unlit eyes,
We kneel before thee:
And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us
Flowers from thy thin cold hands,
And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,
Thou sealest our eyes
And the illimitable quietude
Comes gently upon us.",0

Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things

 All sizes, subjects: khaki brothers in France;
Or mother's faces worn with countless dolours;
 Or girls whose eyes were challenging and must dance,

 Ill-taken card; and childrenfrozen, some

Because a fire was in my head,
And cut and peeled a hazel wand,
And hooked a berry to a thread;

And moth-like stars were flickering out,
I dropped the berry in a stream
And caught a little silver trout.

When I had laid it on the floor
I went to blow the fire a-flame,
But something rustled on the floor,
And someone called me by my name:
It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossom in her hair
Who called me by my name and ran
And faded through the brightening air.

Though I am old with wandering
Through hollow lands and hilly lands,
I will find out where she has gone,
And kiss her lips and take her hands;
And walk among long dappled grass,
And pluck till time and times are done,
The silver apples of the moon,
The golden apples of the sun.",0

That passion warms little
Of flesh in the mold,
And treasure is brittle,

When the world turns completely upside down
You say well emigrate to the Eastern Shore
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;
Well live among wild peach trees, miles from town,
Youll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown
Homespun, dyed butternuts dark gold color.
Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,

Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.

A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;
The spring begins before the winters over.

We shall live well we shall live very well.

The months between the cherries and the peaches
Are brimming cornucopias which spill
Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;

Well trample bright persimmons, while you kill
Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.

Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones
Theres something in this richness that I hate.
I love the look, austere, immaculate,
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.
Theres something in my very blood that owns
Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,
A thread of water, churned to milky spate
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.

I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,

Better go down upon your marrow-bones

Yes, and the blackbird spread its tail, 
So that the sun may speckle, 
While it creaks hail.

You dweller in the dark cabin, 
Rise, since rising will not waken, 
And hail, cry hail, cry hail.",0
"Come when the nights are bright with stars
Or come when the moon is mellow;
Come when the sun his golden bars
Drops on the hay-field yellow.
Come in the twilight soft and gray,
Come in the night or come in the day,
Come, O love, wheneer you may,
And you are welcome, welcome.

You are sweet, O Love, dear Love,
You are soft as the nesting dove.
Come to my heart and bring it to rest
As the bird flies home to its welcome nest.

Come when my heart is full of grief
Or when my heart is merry;
Come with the falling of the leaf
Or with the reddning cherry.
Come when the years first blossom blows,
Come when the summer gleams and glows,
Come with the winters drifting snows,
And you are welcome, welcome.",0
"While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:
Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.
At fourteen I married My Lord you.
I never laughed, being bashful.
Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.

At fifteen I stopped scowling,
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours
Forever and forever, and forever.
Why should I climb the look out?

At sixteen you departed
You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,
And you have been gone five months.
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.

You dragged your feet when you went out.
By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,
Too deep to clear them away!
The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August
Over the grass in the West garden;
They hurt me.
I grow older.
If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,
Please let me know beforehand,
And I will come out to meet you
As far as Cho-fu-Sa.",0
"Since there is no escape, since at the end
My body will be utterly destroyed,
This hand I love as I have loved a friend,
This body I tended, wept with and enjoyed;
Since there is no escape even for me
Who love life with a love too sharp to bear:
The scent of orchards in the rain, the sea
And hours alone too still and sure for prayer
Since darkness waits for me, then all the more
Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore
In pride, and let me sing with my last breath;
In these few hours of light I lift my head;
Life is my loverI shall leave the dead
If there is any way to baffle death.",0
"Too high, too high to pluck
My heart shall swing.
A fruit no bee shall suck,
No wasp shall sting.

If on some night of cold
It falls to ground
In apple-leaves of gold
Ill wrap it round.

And I shall seal it up
With spice and salt,
In a carven silver cup,
In a deep vault.

Before my eyes are blind
And my lips mute,
I must eat core and rind
Of that same fruit.

Before my heart is dust
At the end of all,
Eat it I must, I must
Were it bitter gall.

But I shall keep it sweet
By some strange art;
Wild honey I shall eat
When I eat my heart.

O honey cool and chaste
As clovers breath!
Sweet Heaven I shall taste
Before my death.",0
"When the first dark had fallen around them
And the leaves were weary of praise,
In the clear silence Beauty found them
And shewed them all her ways.

In the high noon of the heavenly garden
Where the angels sunned with the birds,
Beauty, before their hearts could harden,
Had taught them heavenly words.

When they fled in the burning weather
And nothing dawned but a dream,
Beauty fasted their hands together
And cooled them at her stream.

And when day wearied and night grew stronger,
And they slept as the beautiful must,
Then she bided a little longer,
And blossomed from their dust.",0
"My love looks like a girl to-night,
 But she is old.
The plaits that lie along her pillow
 Are not gold,
But threaded with filigree silver,
 And uncanny cold.

She looks like a young maiden, since her brow
 Is smooth and fair,
Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.
 She sleeps a rare
Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.

Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams
 Of perfect things.
She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,
 And her dead mouth sings
By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings.",0
"The jester walked in the garden:
The garden had fallen still;
He bade his soul rise upward
And stand on her window-sill.

It rose in a straight blue garment,
When owls began to call:
It had grown wise-tongued by thinking
Of a quiet and light footfall;

But the young queen would not listen;
She rose in her pale night-gown;
She drew in the heavy casement
And pushed the latches down.

He bade his heart go to her,
When the owls called out no more;
In a red and quivering garment
It sang to her through the door.

It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming
Of a flutter of flower-like hair;
But she took up her fan from the table
And waved it off on the air.

'I have cap and bells, he pondered,
'I will send them to her and die;
And when the morning whitened
He left them where she went by.

She laid them upon her bosom,
Under a cloud of her hair,
And her red lips sang them a love-song
Till stars grew out of the air.

She opened her door and her window,
And the heart and the soul came through,
To her right hand came the red one,
To her left hand came the blue.

They set up a noise like crickets,
A chattering wise and sweet,
And her hair was a folded flower
And the quiet of love in her feet.",0
"What large, dark hands are those at the window
Lifted, grasping the golden light
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves
 To my heart's delight?

Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,
In the west I see a redness come
Over the evening's burning breast 
 'Tis the wound of love goes home!

The woodbine creeps abroad
Calling low to her lover:
The sun-lit flirt who all the day
Has poised above her lips in play
And stolen kisses, shallow and gay
Of pollen, now has gone away
 She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,
And when above her his broad wings hover
Then her bright breast she will uncover
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.

Into the yellow, evening glow
Saunters a man from the farm below,
Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.
The bird lies warm against the wall.
She glances quick her startled eyes
Towards him, then she turns away
Her small head, making warm display
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway
Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies
In one blue stoop from out the sties
Into the evening's empty hall.

Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes
Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,
Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.

The rabbit presses back her ears,
Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes
And crouches low: then with wild spring
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming
To be choked back, the wire ring
Her frantic effort throttling:
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!

Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes
And ready to open in brown surprise
Should I not answer to his talk
Or should he my tears surmise.

I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair
Watching the door open: he flashes bare
His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board
And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword
Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud
His coming: he raises up my face to him
And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim
Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!
I know not what fine wire is round my throat,
I only know I let him finger there
My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood
Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood
Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown
Within him, die, and find death good.",0
"Supper comes at five o'clock,
At six, the evening star,
My lover comes at eight o'clock
But eight o'clock is far.

How could I bear my pain all day
Unless I watched to see
The clock-hands laboring to bring
Eight o'clock to me.",0
"Go, dumb-born book,
Tell her that sang me once that song of Lawes:
Hadst thou but song
As thou hast subjects known,
Then were there cause in thee that should condone
Even my faults that heavy upon me lie
And build her glories their longevity.

Tell her that sheds
Such treasure in the air,
Recking naught else but that her graces give
Life to the moment,
I would bid them live
As roses might, in magic amber laid,
Red overwrought with orange and all made
One substance and one colour
Braving time.

Tell her that goes
With song upon her lips
But sings not out the song, nor knows
The maker of it, some other mouth,
May be as fair as hers,
Might, in new ages, gain her worshippers,
When our two dusts with Wallers shall be laid,
Siftings on siftings in oblivion,
Till change hath broken down
All things save Beauty alone.",0
"They came to tell your faults to me,
They named them over one by one;
I laughed aloud when they were done,
I knew them all so well before, 
Oh, they were blind, too blind to see
Your faults had made me love you more.",0
"I never knew the earth had so much gold
The fields run over with it, and this hill
Hoary and old,
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.

Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good
This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!
This fringe of wood,
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.

You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see
Your face grow mystical, as on that night
You turned to me,
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.

Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;
The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .
And you become
A goddess standing in a world of fire!",0
"When she rises in the morning
I linger to watch her;
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window
And the sunbeams catch her
Glistening white on the shoulders,
While down her sides the mellow
Golden shadow glows as
She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts
Sway like full-blown yellow
Gloire de Dijon roses.

She drips herself with water, and her shoulders
Glisten as silver, they crumple up
Like wet and falling roses, and I listen
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.
In the window full of sunlight
Concentrates her golden shadow
Fold on fold, until it glows as
Mellow as the glory roses.",0
"Version 1 (1921)
Yours is the shame and sorrow,
But the disgrace is mine;
Your love was dark and thorough,
Mine was the love of the sun for a flower
He creates with his shine.

I was diligent to explore you,
Blossom you stalk by stalk,
Till my fire of creation bore you
Shrivelling down in the final dour
Anguish then I suffered a balk.

I knew your pain, and it broke
My fine, craftsman's nerve;
Your body quailed at my stroke,
And my courage failed to give you the last
Fine torture you did deserve.

You are shapely, you are adorned,
But opaque and dull in the flesh,
Who, had I but pierced with the thorned
Fire-threshing anguish, were fused and cast
In a lovely illumined mesh.

Like a painted window: the best
Suffering burnt through your flesh,
Undrossed it and left it blest
With a quivering sweet wisdom of grace: but now
Who shall take you afresh?

Now who will burn you free
From your body's terrors and dross,
Since the fire has failed in me?
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough
The shrieking cross?

A mute, nearly beautiful thing
Is your face, that fills me with shame
As I see it hardening,
Warping the perfect image of God,
And darkening my eternal fame.

Version 2 (1928)
Yours is the sullen sorrow,
The disgrace is also mine;
Your love was intense and thorough,
Mine was the love of a growing flower
For the sunshine.

You had the power to explore me,
Blossom me stalk by stalk;
You woke my spirit, you bore me
To consciousness, you gave me the dour
Awareness then I suffered a balk.

Body to body I could not
Love you, although I would.
We kissed, we kissed though we should not.
You yielded, we threw the last cast,
And it was no good.

You only endured, and it broke
My craftsman's nerve.
No flesh responded to my stroke;
So I failed to give you the last
Fine torture you did deserve.

You are shapely, you are adorned
But opaque and null in the flesh;
Who, had I but pierced with the thorned
Full anguish, perhaps had been cast
In a lovely illuinined mesh

Like a painted window; the best
Fire passed through your flesh,
Undrossed it, and left it blest
In clean new awareness. But now
Who shall take you afresh?

Now who will burn you free
From your body's deadness and dross?
Since the fire has failed in me,
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough
The shrieking cross?

A mute, nearly beautiful thing
Is your face, that fills me with shame
As I see it hardening;
I should have been cruel enough to bring
You through the flame.",0
"Strephon kissed me in the spring,
Robin in the fall,
But Colin only looked at me
And never kissed at all.

Strephon's kiss was lost in jest,
Robin's lost in play,
But the kiss in Colin's eyes
Haunts me night and day.",0
"Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
Oh, do not ask, What is it?
Let us go and make our visit.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

And indeed there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the works and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

And indeed there will be time
To wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?
Time to turn back and descend the stair,
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair 
(They will say: How his hair is growing thin!)
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin 
(They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!)
Do I dare
Disturb the universe?
In a minute there is time
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

For I have known them all already, known them all:
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room.
 So how should I presume?

And I have known the eyes already, known them all
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
 And how should I presume?

And I have known the arms already, known them all
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)
Is it perfume from a dress
That makes me so digress?
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
 And should I then presume?
 And how should I begin?

Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...

I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
Smoothed by long fingers,
Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet and heres no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
Would it have been worth while,
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it towards some overwhelming question,
To say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all
If one, settling a pillow by her head
 Should say: That is not what I meant at all;
 That is not it, at all.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
Would it have been worth while,
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor
And this, and so much more?
It is impossible to say just what I mean!
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
Would it have been worth while
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
And turning toward the window, should say:
 That is not it at all,
 That is not what I meant, at all.

No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
Am an attendant lord, one that will do
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
Deferential, glad to be of use,
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous
Almost, at times, the Fool.

I grow old ... I grow old ...
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

I do not think that they will sing to me.

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black.
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.",0
"I went to the dances at Chandlerville,
And played snap-out at Winchester.
One time we changed partners,
Driving home in the moonlight of middle June,
And then I found Davis.
We were married and lived together for seventy years,
Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children,
Eight of whom we lost
Ere I had reached the age of sixty.
I spun, I wove, I kept the house, I nursed the sick,
I made the garden, and for holiday
Rambled over the fields where sang the larks,
And by Spoon River gathering many a shell,
And many a flower and medicinal weed 
Shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys.
At ninety-six I had lived enough, that is all,
And passed to a sweet repose.
What is this I hear of sorrow and weariness,
Anger, discontent and drooping hopes?
Degenerate sons and daughters,
Life is too strong for you 
It takes life to love Life.",0

"I saw her in a Broadway car,
The woman I might grow to be;
I felt my lover look at her
And then turn suddenly to me.

Her hair was dull and drew no light
And yet its color was as mine;
Her eyes were strangely like my eyes
Tho' love had never made them shine.

Her body was a thing grown thin,
Hungry for love that never came;
Her soul was frozen in the dark
Unwarmed forever by love's flame.

I felt my lover look at her
And then turn suddenly to me, 
His eyes were magic to defy
The woman I shall never be.",0
" 
Just as my fingers on these keys
Make music, so the selfsame sounds
On my spirit make a music, too.

Music is feeling, then, not sound;
And thus it is that what I feel,
Here in this room, desiring you,

Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk,
Is music. It is like the strain
Waked in the elders by Susanna: 

Of a green evening, clear and warm,
She bathed in her still garden, while
The red-eyed elders, watching, felt

The basses of their beings throb
In witching chords, and their thin blood
Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.



In the green water, clear and warm,
Susanna lay.
She searched
The touch of springs,
And found
Concealed imaginings.
She sighed,
For so much melody.

Upon the bank, she stood
In the cool
Of spent emotions.
She felt, among the leaves,
The dew
Of old devotions.

She walked upon the grass,
Still quavering.
The winds were like her maids,
On timid feet,
Fetching her woven scarves,
Yet wavering.

A breath upon her hand
Muted the night.
She turned
A cymbal crashed,
And roaring horns.



Soon, with a noise like tambourines,
Came her attendant Byzantines.

They wondered why Susanna cried
Against the elders by her side;

And as they whispered, the refrain
Was like a willow swept by rain.

Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame
Revealed Susanna and her shame.

And then, the simpering Byzantines
Fled, with a noise like tambourines.


Beauty is momentary in the mind
The fitful tracing of a portal;
But in the flesh it is immortal.

The body dies; the body's beauty lives.
So evenings die, in their green going,
A wave, interminably flowing.
So gardens die, their meek breath scenting
The cowl of winter, done repenting.
So maidens die, to the auroral
Celebration of a maiden's choral.

Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings
Of those white elders; but, escaping,
Left only Death's ironic scraping.
Now, in its immortality, it plays
On the clear viol of her memory,
And makes a constant sacrament of praise.",0
"
Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
You have the scene arrange itself as it will seem to do
With ""I have saved this afternoon for you"";
And four wax candles in the darkened room,
Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
""So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
Should be resurrected only among friends
Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.""
And so the conversation slips
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
Through attenuated tones of violins
Mingled with remote cornets
And begins.

""You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,
And how, how rare and strange it is, to find
In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,
(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!
How keen you are!)
To find a friend who has these qualities,
Who has, and gives
Those qualities upon which friendship lives.
How much it means that I say this to you 
Without these friendships life, what cauchemar!""
Among the winding of the violins
And the ariettes
Of cracked cornets
Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins
Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,
Capricious monotone
That is at least one definite ""false note.""
 Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,
Admire the monuments,
Discuss the late events,
Correct our watches by the public clocks.
Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.

Now that lilacs are in bloom
She has a bowl of lilacs in her room
And twists one in her fingers while she talks.
""Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know
What life is, you who hold it in your hands"";
(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)
""You let it flow from you, you let it flow,
And youth is cruel, and has no remorse
And smiles at situations which it cannot see.""
I smile, of course,
And go on drinking tea.
""Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall
My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,
I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world
To be wonderful and youthful, after all.""

The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune
Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:
""I am always sure that you understand
My feelings, always sure that you feel,
Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.

You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel.
You will go on, and when you have prevailed
You can say: at this point many a one has failed.

But what have I, but what have I, my friend,
To give you, what can you receive from me?
Only the friendship and the sympathy
Of one about to reach her journey's end.

I shall sit here, serving tea to friends ....""

I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends
For what she has said to me?
You will see me any morning in the park
Reading the comics and the sporting page.
Particularly I remark.
An English countess goes upon the stage.
A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,
Another bank defaulter has confessed.
I keep my countenance,
I remain self-possessed
Except when a street-piano, mechanical and tired
Reiterates some worn-out common song
With the smell of hyacinths across the garden
Recalling things that other people have desired.
Are these ideas right or wrong?

The October night comes down; returning as before
Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease
I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door
And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.
""And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?
But that's a useless question.
You hardly know when you are coming back,
You will find so much to learn.""
My smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac.

""Perhaps you can write to me.""
My self-possession flares up for a second;
This is as I had reckoned.
""I have been wondering frequently of late
(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
Why we have not developed into friends.""
I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark
Suddenly, his expression in a glass.
My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.

""For everybody said so, all our friends,
They all were sure our feelings would relate
So closely! I myself can hardly understand.
We must leave it now to fate.
You will write, at any rate.
Perhaps it is not too late.
I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.""
And I must borrow every changing shape
To find expression ... dance, dance
Like a dancing bear,
Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.
Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance
Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,
Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;
Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand
With the smoke coming down above the housetops;
Doubtful, for quite a while
Not knowing what to feel or if I understand
Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ...
Would she not have the advantage, after all?
This music is successful with a ""dying fall""
Now that we talk of dying
And should I have the right to smile?",0
"Maurice, weep not, I am not here under this pine tree.
The balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass,
The stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls,
But thou grievest, while my soul lies rapturous
In the blest Nirvana of eternal light!
Go to the good heart that is my husband,
Who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i
Tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him
Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh
I won spirit, and through spirit, peace.
There is no marriage in heaven,
But there is love.",0
"I shall not go with pain
Whether you hold me, whether you forget
My little loss and my immortal gain.
O flower unseen, O fountain sealed apart!
Give me one look, one look remembering yet,
Sweet heart.

I shall not go with grief,
Whether you call me, whether you deny
The crowning vintage and the golden sheaf.
O, April hopes that blossom but to close!
Give me one look, one look and so good-bye,
Red rose.

I shall not go with sighs,
But as full-crowned the warrior leaves the fight,
Dawn on his shield and death upon his eyes.
O, life so bitter-sweet and heaven so far!
Give me one look, one look and so good night,
My star.",0

"This youth too long has heard the break
Of waters in a land of change.
He goes to see what suns can make
From soil more indurate and strange.

He cuts what holds his days together
And shuts him in, as lock on lock:
The arrowed vane announcing weather,
The tripping racket of a clock;

Seeking, I think, a light that waits
Still as a lamp upon a shelf, 
A land with hills like rocky gates
Where no sea leaps upon itself.

But he will find that nothing dares
To be enduring, save where, south
Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares
On beauty with a rusted mouth, 

Where something dreadful and another
Look quietly upon each other.",0
"Making his advances
He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,
No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank.

Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin
That work beneath her while she sprawls along
In her ungainly pace,
Her folds of skin that work and row
Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves.

And so he strains beneath her housey walls
And catches her trouser-legs in his beak
Suddenly, or her skinny limb,
And strange and grimly drags at her
Like a dog,
Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful persistency.

Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed.
Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation
And doomed to partiality, partial being,
Ache, and want of being,
Want,
Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her.

Born to walk alone,
Forerunner,
Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track,
This awkward, harrowing pursuit,
This grim necessity from within.

Does she know
As she moves eternally slowly away?
Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark against a window,
All knowledgeless?

The awful concussion,
And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue,
Driven, after ons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness,
At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,
Driven away from himself into her tracks,
Forced to crash against her.

Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,
Little gentleman,
Sorry plight,
We ought to look the other way.

Save that, having come with you so far,
We will go on to the end.",0
"I thought he was dumb,
I said he was dumb,
Yet I've heard him cry.

First faint scream,
Out of life's unfathomable dawn,
Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon's dawning rim,
Far, far off, far scream.

Tortoise in extremis.

Why were we crucified into sex?
Why were we not left rounded off, and finished in ourselves,
As we began,
As he certainly began, so perfectly alone?

A far, was-it-audible scream,
Or did it sound on the plasm direct?

Worse than the cry of the new-born,
A scream,
A yell,
A shout,
A pan,
A death-agony,
A birth-cry,
A submission,
All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first dawn.

War-cry, triumph, acute-delight, death-scream reptilian,
Why was the veil torn?
The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?
The male soul's membrane
Torn with a shriek half music, half horror.

Crucifixion.
Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of that dense female,
Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching out of the shell
In tortoise-nakedness,
Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded, spread-eagle over her house-roof,
And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved beneath her walls,
Reaching and gripping tense, more reaching anguish in uttermost tension
Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping like a jerking leap, and oh!
Opening its clenched face from his outstretched neck
And giving that fragile yell, that scream,
Super-audible,
From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth,
Giving up the ghost,
Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost.

His scream, and his moment's subsidence,
The moment of eternal silence,
Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling jerk of coition, and at once
The inexpressible faint yell 
And so on, till the last plasm of my body was melted back
To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret.

So he tups, and screams
Time after time that frail, torn scream
After each jerk, the longish interval,
The tortoise eternity,
Agelong, reptilian persistence,
Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the next spasm.

I remember, when I was a boy,
I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught with his foot in the mouth of an up-starting snake;
I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break into sound in the spring;
I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat of night
Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters;
I remember the first time, out of a bush in the darkness, a nightingale's piercing cries and gurgles startled the depths of my soul;
I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went through a wood at midnight;
I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and blorting through the hours, persistent and irrepressible;
I remember my first terror hearing the howl of weird, amorous cats;
I remember the scream of a terrified, injured horse, the sheet-lightning
And running away from the sound of a woman in labor, something like an owl whooing,
And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a lamb,
The first wail of an infant,
And my mother singing to herself,
And the first tenor singing of the passionate throat of a young collier, who has long since drunk himself to death,
The first elements of foreign speech
On wild dark lips.

And more than all these,
And less than all these,
This last,
Strange, faint coition yell
Of the male tortoise at extremity,
Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest far-off horizon of life.

The cross,
The wheel on which our silence first is broken,
Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single inviolability, our deep silence
Tearing a cry from us.

Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling across the deeps, calling, calling for the complement,
Singing, and calling, and singing again, being answered, having found.

Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking for what is lost,
The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ, the Osiris-cry of abandonment,
That which is whole, torn asunder,
That which is in part, finding its whole again throughout the universe.",0
"With the man I love who loves me not,
I walked in the street-lamps' flare;
We watched the world go home that night
In a flood through Union Square.

I leaned to catch the words he said
That were light as a snowflake falling;
Ah well that he never leaned to hear
The words my heart was calling.

And on we walked and on we walked
Past the fiery lights of the picture shows 
Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by
On the errand each man knows.

And on we walked and on we walked,
At the door at last we said good-bye;
I knew by his smile he had not heard
My heart's unuttered cry.

With the man I love who loves me not
I walked in the street-lamps' flare 
But oh, the girls who ask for love
In the lights of Union Square.",0
"When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;

How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;

And bending down beside the glowing bars,
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
And paced upon the mountains overhead
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.",0
"Give me hunger,
O you gods that sit and give
The world its orders.
Give me hunger, pain and want,
Shut me out with shame and failure
From your doors of gold and fame,
Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!

But leave me a little love,
A voice to speak to me in the day end,
A hand to touch me in the dark room
Breaking the long loneliness.
In the dusk of day-shapes
Blurring the sunset,
One little wandering, western star
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.
Let me go to the window,
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk
And wait and know the coming
Of a little love.",0
"Potuia, potuia
White grave goddess,
Pity my sadness,
O silence of Paros.

I am not of these about thy feet,
These garments and decorum;
I am thy brother,
Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,
And thou hearest me not.

I have whispered thee in thy solitudes
Of our loves in Phrygia,
The far ecstasy of burning noons
When the fragile pipes
Ceased in the cypress shade,
And the brown fingers of the shepherd
Moved over slim shoulders;
And only the cicada sang.

I have told thee of the hills
And the lisp of reeds
And the sun upon thy breasts,

And thou hearest me not,
Potuia, potuia
Thou hearest me not.",0
"Harald prepares her breakfast. Egg on toast. Black coffee. Just like she says she likes it.‘Sorry, I’ll grab something on the way’. Breakfasts are for lazy people. Her clock ticks in premium intervals. #BulimiaRecovery are the trending hashtags in her timeline for today. She storms into the Committee Room, no espresso in her hand. The PA immediately makes her one, offers to carry it on a tray, but she holds the cup through her long sleeve, two for one, she covered her sticking-out wrist bone. ‘Success comes from sacrifice’. She delivers the presentation, feels dizzy at the end, has to count three times how many attendees raised their Zoom hands.A five-minute break. She scrolls down news feeds, replies to the most urgent emails. What did Harald pack for lunch? Potato salad. ‘Can’t afford a slump!’ she throws it in the bin, shakes off the dreaded energy drop, the fear of impaired judgment induced by Harald’s ‘Love You’ post-it-note. 8:30PM, her Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn are full of afterwork pints. She has never held a tall glass. She rarely touches anything, pays contactless for fast track, only carries a phone in her iconic black bag. Harald rings her   ̶   the fifth time. She cuts the ringing short, types a chunk of her report.Puts one ice cube on top of her hand to ease the Carpal Tunnel,one ice cube in her mouth to keep her awake. ‘Darling, come to bed, it’s 2 AM’. She presses the nightgown tight to her slim body, doesn’t like loose-fitting flared cotton, prefers to wear a uniform: one for the boss, one for Harald, one for the child that was supposed to change it all but thatin the tenth week stopped growing and never saw her wearing the beige breastfeeding top. Natural occurrence. She dashes the tear away. The clock keeps feeding her to-do-list; she squeezes it in her fist, but the list grows bigger, its wide-open mouth devours the table, the fridge with bills that are again overdue, the city that never sleeps,the land that bred feminists bleeding in Corporate Blue.

"He was not as I remembered himfrom the day they had taken him down. As if the fire had already begun to consume him.His eyes were sunk in their sockets now, like mussels - bruise-purple shells wide open,larger, brighter, as if he already beheld that infinity of which he spoke with such intensity. We had given him many chances to recant, to abandon his dance with demons.At times, he wavered and it seemed as if his soul would be redeemed.But accursed obstinacy barred his way as firmly as the door of the cell where he sat in vaulted darkness, risking his own sanity, for eight long years in the company of his errors and grievous vanities. Like the others, I had recommended torture, to free his spirit from the importunate influences that kept it in thrall to his heresies. Not because I had wished him ill. Verily, strictures that lead the will to repentance and thence to life are better than death at the stake, unrepentant – limited use of the knife in interrogation gives less pain, than the flames of eternal damnation. Of course, we could not accept his claim, that the universe was infinite.If that was true, where would God reside? The sun, moon and all the stars glide round the earth on crystal spheres, and outside the outermost lies heaven, the Lord and all his angels – order quintessential.The world could ill afford his potential chaos. One day in session, when I said this, he was seized with a distemper.He said I had surrendered my mind to lazy blind obedience. Think!he shouted. Prove to me that the universe is finite. I said I had no need to prove what the ancients taught was true - and warned him to pay heed.He said, It is not I who is on trial, but you. Then he laughed and said my idea of God was paltry, parsimonious.He asked me to imagine a hilltop on a winter’s night - the loneliness, the frost-clear stars,like precious stones on a noble’s robe. Stand there, on your own, he said,without pre-conceptions, and know each star is a fiery sun, rising new each morningto bring dawn to its encircling worlds. With a toss of his arrogant head, he said that God is glorified not by one but a thousand suns. Not by a single world but by a thousand, thousand - many, doubtless, with their own living beings. He invited us to see with himan infinity of worlds in motion - and ours as but a grain of sand on the floor of an endless ocean. I said I could not see a place for God in the infinity he described.Retreating inside himself, he replied that matter and spirit are one.That God is not in a separate heaven but is the soul of all – the leaventhat causes all forms to arise. His voice was soft but conviction spoke loud, without fear from his eyes. It rang in my ears like a gentle magic, and then, like a memory. A window was open, and the cool night air breathed softly, like a friend. A voice said There is no beginning, as there is no end to the fountain of my being and my stars cannot be counted, because always there will be one more. I felt a freedom I had not explored since boyhood,felt tears wet my eyes and I recognised his joy as the joy in me, when I used to lie on the hill behind my house and stare up through the night, dare to wonder how a star would look if I could fly up close. Would my eyes be able to bear the proximity of such brightness?Then I would go inside and play a game, light a candleand stare as long as I could bear, deep into the flame. Peering into the heart of a star, there were no celestial spheres.No Aristotelian hood, placed by the Church in later years to cover my young man’s eyes.The hood, that would calm my inquisitive mind and keep me motionless,parked like a falcon in leather-bound darkon his master’s gauntlet. The memory haunted me. I did penance alone in my room, the crucifix – leadin my hand. But instead of forgiveness I felt a dread, which I could not explain away.Which from that day, took root in my soul and when I heard him say, Perhaps you pronounce this sentence against me with greater fear, than I receive it ,that same dread demanded of me, that I should believe it. I felt the dread weave and knot itselfaround and through me like leash and jesses, holding a falcon in check,however hard it tries to peck them loose and fly free. Today in the square we will light a candle, in the square of the Field of Flowersand I will stare at the flame, the window open to feel the heat of the powerof the Holy Office, the power that will devour him. I will stare at the flame, my hood thrown back like an empty sack,like the hood of a novice. I will stare at the flame. I will stare. Will my eyes be able to bear the proximity of such brightness?

"From the Big Bang came planet earth,Along with stars, galaxies, space, and planets.The Sun and Moon are essential in this universe,for all things happenstance of struggle, if only for a microsecond. The evolution of multicellular organisms surpassed many phases,Neanderthal to Homo Sapiens journey makes everyone amazed.Journey of each evolutionary phase passes through many struggles,Anyone can see the contour of human evolution through a wide-angle. The journey of tadpole to frog, embryo to baby, cocoon to butterfly,Sees the division of cells into nuclei that pass through many stages.Perhaps it is the law of nature, that every part of creation must face varying struggles and rules that apply. Plants and animals in deserts are in perfect unison,Though there is a struggle for survival,They are perfect companions.The visible world, animate, and inanimate constitute our worldly heaven. With passage of time, early human beings discovered fire,Made settlements and sustained their life through agriculture,Hunting to heating and cooking,Learned to protect their body through clothing. Old stone age, new stone age laid the foundation of modern civilization,All ages ensured the survival of the fittest principles for plants, animals including humans.The struggle is still on, and we harbinger of new scientific and technological innovations,The First, Second, Third and Fourth industrial revolutions. The world today boasts 8 billion people,In spite, every country is trying hard for further expansion.Land, air, water, and minerals facing the wrath of exploitation,Many floras, fauna, and local inhabitants are on the verge of extinction, Millions of people across the world facing starvation,Due to less food production and increasing population.There is an imbalance in daily food and nutrition,Which may extend to the next generation.

"In the greatest library of the ancient worldHypatia turned her mind to algebra, astronomy, geometry,examining the world from different angles. While they jumped to conclusions, she used careful calculation to counter prejudice with reason. While they weaponized words, she invented instruments to measure the Moon. While they struggled for power, she struggled to save booksas Alexandria’s great library burned. Hypatia taught that much of reality lies beyond our senses:the whole is greater than any part,there is truth that remains unseen. Hypatia knew that all right angles are equal, despaired that all people are not. As Alexandria’s beauty unravelled,her city cast into chaos,Hypatia remained a symbol of science. For this, she was dragged from her chariot killed by a mob armed with rubble from a roof. They tried to silence her. But Hypatia can still be heard: a reverberationthrough mathematicsthrough sciencethrough space. An echo that reaches the lunar equator, the impact crater,that bears her name. While we jump to conclusions, weaponize words, struggle for power, she continues to teach: that the greatest impactis never made by stick nor stone, but the chance to think,to learn, to know. ",1

"Content warning: Mental health Ate breakfast today. Do not know what day of the week it is but I convince myself it is Friday. There is magic in the forgetting and how you can negotiate with the remembering. I associate happiness with Fridays and only half know why but I consider this enough. I strip off my night clothes, shower, and put on my day clothes. My atoms reshuffle themselves to assemble something remotely human. I feel like a periodic table of unspoken elements and I fight the urge of closing the curtains and going back to bed. I put on a jacket and gravity becomes so strong, it pulls all of my breath into myself. I leave the house and it feels like stepping off the edge of a spaceship. This atmosphere is so foreign these days. Horses flock to the fences as I walk past them. A dog finds its way to my legs. There is an intuition in animals to sense when somebody needs comforting. I wander through the woods, I find a rock to sit on and I cry. I finally exhale. I stand up and head home. I fill a notepad with words searching for something better than an apology but end up right back at ‘I’m sorry’. I am sorry I am so sad. It has been such a good week but I woke up this morning feeling like a balloon with a bullet hole and I am trying so hard to shift it. I know nothing I have listed sounds like an accomplishment but some days, being alive is a profession I do not feel qualified for. I do not put on the television. I read books until my eyes hurt. I listen to music on full volume to try and drown out my thoughts. I just want you to know I am trying. I know all of this is chemistry but who decided I was an atom bomb? ",1
"Studies show seven hours is sufficient.Less is admirable - a true inspiration of fortitude!More is a cause for worry,a cry of poor character is roused. This society built on productivity,curates a state of being in constant motion.The greatest act of self-preservationcan therefore be found in stillness. Tear down society’s strict structures.Become unreachable.Pull up the duvet.Find solace in the horizontal. So, you see, I’m taking it back, my allotted time.In fact, I’m stealing seven more.Let me wake to snack, socialise, and slow down,Before returning to slumber. For the sun is set,the snow has fallen.Outside is a dark, cold, and unforgiving place.The creatures of this world are retreating.Give me softness, give me silence. Thousands of years of evolutionary science, is here to question your seven hours. ",1
"We were born where our ancestors were,We bore many problems to reach there.We run once a year and even cross roads,And that is a spectacle to behold. We are pitted against a force,To run nature’s course.Just to reach our source,Without any remorse. We start tiny and go through stages,And this has been going on for ages.We start fresh, then go to the salty paradise,Years later we return, much bigger in size. You may think that we juggle,But our life is a struggle.We travel for miles and jump high,All this without a hue and cry. Many of us sacrifice ourselves for the future,An unfortunate end to our adventure.This repeats year after year,And let me make that clear. Whales, bears and many more,These creatures we abhor.They make us their meal,And that is surely a big deal. Our biggest enemies aren’t any of those,As we have greater foes.Dams, overfishing, invasive species,And climate change are our true worries. ",1
"Struggle, turn, toss, yearn, loss.Has it ever not been thus?“A cursed state,” we opineand seek solace in eternal rhyme. Yet in modern poems, though full of passion,rhyme has fallen foul of fashion. But what is science, if not the searchfor nature’s perfect balanced verse?Is there a super-symmetrical chimethat rings out through cosmic time?Could science be the final churchthat communes the last rhyme with the first? Man peers over the event horizon and divines the future which eternity dies in.The cosmic winds falling still,the stars will dim, the galaxies wilt,long after God’s first exalted breathis exhausted, leaving only heatless death. Man, who knows that he knows,then struggles in an endless forageto find a word that rhymes with orange.Can science ease his troubled mind,and find, through a process empirical,the cosmos possessing truth that’s lyrical? A proton for an electron, the photonic spark set against the dark.An up quark for a down quark, yes, that is how it ought to work! Man’s every action met with equal opposition,the struggle itself, proof of purpose, not attrition! But rhyme is its own form of oppression.Break free from form, rejoice! What meaning divined from the undivinecould replace man’s own voice?As poetry requires an all-blank page,only against the void can man truly rage. Even so, all will come to an endless end, the stilling of the cosmic wind. A final end that has no rhyme, no harmonizing reply. From the gravity grave of heatless death, can there be another breath?

"They came straight through townin those days, streaming thick as thieves along the roads that wander through all our hillside villages, alone, mostly,but sometimes in little scuffling bandsled by their ecstatic, bedraggled visionsin search of an audienceand always grateful for a crust. Each one of them delivered urgent newsof divinity’s most recent fit of peeve, and all the heavens thundered from their great purple lips as rage ran red into their howling eyes and words which,hoarse with prophecy and admonition, showered a blistering conflagrationupon our people’s slackened practicesto make their strongest argumentfor the glories of a hasty crucifixion. This one, they tell me, though,was of a milder temperament than most.I wouldn’t know. He was up and gonebefore the shapes and colors of my blinking world returned. A reticent master of the cautionary tale, you had to cup your hand around your earto hear him speak, they say, so softly blandishingwas his rhetoric.  But if you listened closely,this latest Jesus (the third of that name to visit our neighborhood in the space of two years) claimed special kinship with the Most-High, and crowned himself the bringer of a leaner law.Surrounded by his publicistsand burly crowd-control specialists,he was determined to make his mark of meekness in a crowded field of ill-tempered oracles here belowand an even greater gaggle of noisy, jealous deities out yonder. He needed something splashy, this shy purveyance of glad tidings,and I was that place, it seems,where preparation metwith opportunity. And so here I sit againupon the porch of my eternity,a softly breathing masterpiece of taxidermyfor every passerby to ogle at, the inconvenient marvel of our village,a livid carcass snatched from sleep,the unvanished, the undisappearingnebbish at the bosom of my wary family. Now I only wonder what the future holds, what a future even means here,as the sweet odors of thyme and cedar clingto my sallow, apprehensive flesh,and as the noonday sun warms the winter wheat and glazes shiny brown the faces of our village children pronking in the street,but cannot drive the chill from these charnelled bones of mine or warm the cave-dark hollow of my cheek, now, as the kinsmen creep wide-eyed, stealthy on their shy unsandaled soles into my room at every new day’s breaking lightand gently press this fearful crackling skin as if to test the doneness of a fish upon the coals.

"While it’s always awkward to go to a dance without a partner, without a preferred partner, it’s especially hard in a speedy cosmic world. (And in that world, forgive me, “partners” are called by some, “quarks.”) It is even more awkward when gender is set aside in favor of flavors – but not the ice-cream or FroYo kind. To pile on the agony, these flavors come with embarrassing names like Up, Down, Top and Bottom, and, forgive me once more, Charm and Strange. And, no, this is not an Alice in Wonderland dance, where at any moment one might expect a partner out of a teapot or a teeny door. But it is, perhaps, like an ice-cream world, in the sense that some of these flavors mix different sub-flavors. Ben and Jerry’s One Sweet World brings in coffee caramel, marshmallow, and chocolate chunks in a three-way partnership, kind of like bigamy. Cherry Garcia plays on the Dead with cherries and chocolate chunks (definitely not soggy marshmallow), and, who knows, perhaps Jerry tastes it from his Dark Star. But, back to the dance, where combinations of flavors usually happen in twos or threes. And, as it emerges, in this dance, illustrious invited guests are in combinations of fours and fives. Please welcome the Tetras and Pentas (names that make eminent sense). They come in their well-recognized dress of Charm and Anti-Charm the basic fabric, the other flavors added here and there. Since the music at today’s dance is extra fast (maybe like a Garcia Alabama Getaway), it causes an Anti-Charm to scoot away from Charm… and ooh, the change in flavor, and ooh, the fulsome attraction! Charm becomes enamored of Strange and Up, and Anti-Charm infatuated with Down. What a to-do! Imagine the swing, the speed, the swirl, as the Charm-combo now seeks a permanent rush to separation as they all speed (how fast is it?) along the dance floor! Oh, the flaring, spitting energy!  	The fury!  	How will this end? ",1

The rest: Viruses both present and past We lurch out of their echoesto begrudgingly carry them on Which units then are us or them?We are an accumulation of mergers, and the deeper we cutthe less distinct we become recursively breaking multitudes into more multitudes Until we are just atomsBut where is the life in those?

"Roaming Earth for a few billion years,I came from a distant future to keep an eye on the pastI was tasked with figuring out how big ancient space rocks were.My planet was roughly two trillion away from earth.Space rocks can hardly hit them.I watched as boulders from orbit worked on the Earth's landscape by crashing onto it,New species evolving everywhere.It was at this point that I began making purely speculative measurements What would they do?I delighted in watching T. Rex devour others. Tragically, he and his cronies were wiped away as well.I measured the rock's pace and the ensuing evolutionary leap.“I am never going to live to see the future” That's what I said to a space rock twice as bigger than the earth.She departed without a goodbye, though Iwaited for her, to measure her arrival.As I watched the mortals starting fire,Tame wild but gentle dogs, eat and do weird stuff.That was a bit over the top for me.Random hits did not stop life from rebounding.For eons, I saw Earth's inhabitants build and destroy.Oh boy! I knew planet blue was doomed from the startI grew accustomed and forgot home. My burning passion to measure their end faded away.As years passed, I could see things diminishing.Tremors commenced, oceans dancing to the rhythm of the end.I started my measurements again.Knowing that she will return to destroy the cosmos, I did not return home.I knew my home, this is it.By and by she came with all her grace for meMaybe the space rock was in love with me after all.

That car, alone, motionless on the freeway shoulder	Slowed others to look and wonder and ponder and gawk.	Lanes of 70 mph going 5 mph	Back through the interchange, back for miles,	Brake lights, panic gasps, curses, not so near not misses.That something that happened made so much. That little something, so big an effect	A pea in the throat.	A sneeze.	A single bacteria lying dormant.The zillion ways we let the pin ball fly.

These small things get mixedin particular ways; they get worked uphill to buildnew things, make new life. 2. Do this by yourself:take one deep red roseon a short stem to the gravesite. Place it thereat an acute angle, alone.For Mattie, a wonderful dog. He wasrespectful, kind, andhonor-worthy. He made the worldsmoother by living. 3. Go on a slowwalkabout at a young age: say,16 years or so; the purported purpose then less than crystal—the actual purposemay not be known for years. There’s time then to make change,timeto adjust direction. You can veer to the south—keep the rising sunon your left as you travel and imaginehow a young bird knows without knowing when and how to migrate.Imaginehow generations of Monarchs know without knowingwhen to move north and lay eggson milkweed leaves. The eggs hatch to larvae, which then changeby chrysalis into butterfliesthat know without knowing. But the last ones knowwhen to flutter southover 2,000 ragged miles to overwinter on treesin a forestin central Mexico. 4. From tension comes stressand from stress, chaos. Envision a teapot—one that whistles sharp as a nail when the heat’s onand the pressure’s up. 5. It is difficult to learnall the laws that pertainto righteous things. Are we free from moral defect? Are wevirtuous, worthy, and just?If we do righteous things do we make the world better?Does it matter? 6. Motion results from an upset in stasis,from a change in equilibrium. If I drive carefully at night, not changingmy speed, things passing by let me know—something’s in motion. 7. Honestly,are you honest? Are you courageous, generous, and faireven when you don’t want to be? Have you ever cheatedat solitaire? Did you kick the tires before buying the car? 8. In late autumn even the birdshave troubles: they squabbleover the last seeds in the birdfeeder and they shouldertheir ilk at the suet feederhung by a wire to the trunk of a loblolly pine. Yes, the namerolls from the tongue, a richlather of sound: like leatherleaf. But the birds don’t say it.And they may not think it.Being virtuous is difficult. We do itknowingly now and then and we patourselves on the back when we do. ",1
"With winter comes the death for which its cold is known, But joining it are fragile beings of its own, Containing each a pattern found in one alone.Could random chance allow such wonders to arise?Or must the harmony their fleeting shapes comprise Be fashioned by a master craftsman in the skies? But no such craftsman can be found amid the storm, For only simple laws to which its clouds conformAre seen to cut the facets of their product’s form. From smallest drop of water comes a seed of ice, To grow in sixfold pattern as the blind deviceRefines an angled edge, or branching points precise. And yet, has not examination surely foundThat chaos cannot generate a form so sound?And in the squall where ragged wind and cloud abound, Is not the ruling power one of disarray?Would not a perfect product of this force betrayThe omnipresent law that order must decay? Within the tempest's hidden world of wind and sleet, The frozen speck is born by sacrifice of heat:A thermal duty every crystal must complete.As in the tiny interactions of the sun, Where power surges out as two are fused to one, Such order may be taken from a form undone. To see that from decay must every beauty grow,That all the purest lilies must have graves below, Extinguishes all hope, if one is doomed to know. If this is so, what solace might we ever seek?From no creative mind conceiving forms unique,But only an entropic rust, and future bleak? About the source of beauty, nothing can be said.A thing cannot, when built from patterns of the dead,By wishing be produced by something else instead. But laws of nature show a glory of their own,With deeper roots of order seen by them alone. What Governor it is, or if, is never known. ",1
"Maybe the Natalie Wood part should have gone here. If each moment were an event,What would be the defining parameters?When does one event end and the next begin? I ask because it gets more complicated after that,Because all of those events then somehow (and how is that, exactly?)get strung together into some sort of sequence. At least most of us think they do. I often seem to get hung up on sequencing things.  I have to do them inThe Right Order. I get anxious if I don’t. Sort of like this line of thought here… If I put the part about Natalie Wood right hereInstead of before the other later onOr maybe I should have started with it first? You get a little anxious. Or maybe not, maybe it’s just me. Any way, it is called Brainstorm(Her final movie)and she drowned before they finished filming it. The movie had to do with recording The experience of peoples’ thoughts onto a machine, including how they felt, and when you wore the playback deviceyou experienced the recording as if you were them. But you got to be you at the same time too. So there was this visual sequence whereAll of those event moments Were floating in front of you, And you could pick one to view/experience/playback. Are you following me here? Because if you picked this moment of mine to playback It would smell like desert dust, and off-gassing high-impact copolymer resin. It would taste like fruit cocktail, but old. It would feel like a pain in your left foot, inexplicable, and only the ghost of the usual hip pain. It would sound utterly silent except the clicking of the keyboard. Shit, I forgot you should be listening to String of Pearls while you are reading this –Maybe I should have said so earlier Or did I? I won’t explain what it would look like, because, of course, you already know. It would look like this. That vision of all those event bubbles floating in front of youHas always stuck with me. And you know they filmed the scenes of that movieOut Of Sequence. They had to go re-shoot the end after Natalie died. Out of sequence. I heard an NPR story about Alzheimer and dementia patients last week(or was it the week before?  No, wait, maybe it was the week before that)where a Chicago improv group was teaching them games,so that they could experienceJoy In The Moment. It wasn’t really intended as therapy,Inasmuch as an opportunity to just get them happinessas they went. So I’ve seen that look though,You know the one? Where I just asked and she knows she should know the answerIn fact she does know, or anyway she used to,But slightly panicked, she doesn’t know now. That same look that When the string breaks, and all the pearlsBounce to the groundSome rolling out of reachAcross the foyer, Under the fridgeInside the pianoCrushed into dust underfootBlown away… Washes out of her facewhen she looks up at you. In that moment. Right then. Incredible music, Isn’t it? ",1

Blanched cards, stiff flowers, the occasional chant.What are the certainties we’ll buy this time? Bow to pictures, pray to return to the stars;when each sunrise daylight skins the sky this time. Memory, a disembodied message—ears to tin cans, who can say why this time. A glass jar that housed my heated demons—let loose they won’t be pacified this time. Love: a windowed home, its green panes smashed.Perhaps we’ll learn at last how to die this time. The target slips but the arrow zips its way:Every theory has an alibi this time. Letters interred, the bones of words insist—No resurrection we can prophesy this time. Each grain of chance a doubt accounted for,no more no less, they will not multiply this time. The heart turns, in circles getting smaller,drawn to the same lullaby this time. I wake to find the rose has bled its petals,left its thorn deep in my eye this time. ",1
"The struggle is real. It began with the quintessential spark, a singular explosive moment of time spontaneously igniting the first protest against the existential oppression of absolute nothingness. This inevitably led to unknown numbers of invisible agents secretly causing chaos everywhere, then eventually gave rise to mysteriously self-organizing demonstrations of civil disobedience, which is what catalyzed the movement into an inspirational revolution that even now continues to breathe life into the subversive activities of the nameless masses fighting just to survive, a small few of whom have grown up to become a highly vocal group of disorderly radicals conscientiously challenging the system and universally declaring their right to be free.

"“When you stir your rice pudding...the spoonful of jam spreads itself round making red trails like the picture of a meteor in my astronomical atlas. But if youstir backward, the jam will not come together again. Indeed, the pudding does notnotice and continues to turn pink. Do you think this is odd?...You cannot stirthings apart.” — Tomasina Coverly, at breakfast in Tom Stoppard’s play Arcadia The Second Law of Thermodynamics does notpresume to dictate that which is not made of matterand yet, we still call the beginning of an affair the spark: the Second Law of Thermodynamics states that heatcan never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change connected therewith.It means that heat goes only one way.It means that things can only get colder.It means that ever since the Big Bang,things have been steadily cooling off.In the beginning, (scientists don't really know what happened, but moments afterwardswe do know that) there was a great big heat. This heat powered the reactions that combined to form the creatures which evolved into the people which, eventually, became you. At the beginning of you and I, well, we don’t know what happened either, but there was a whole lot of heat, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics says this is a law of endings, is a death sentence, is the final countdown, is the slowest sigh: things will be hot until they aren’t—your coffee, your summers, your Earth’s core—will be hot until they inevitably aren’tuntil icecaps are oceans are deserts are stardust,until thermal equilibrium. Your love is hotuntil it isn’t: that lingering glance makes rational,room-temperature people spontaneously combust,makes spark, makes heat out of nothingmakes cold into warm, makes Big Bangmakes entire universe that can only cool down.The universe as we know it will cease to exist when all heat is equally distributed, when allof everything is effectively room temperature:the reactants are there, but there's not enoughheat left to power movement, collision, reaction.A relationship as we know it, will cease to existwhen it becomes room temperature: you and Iare still here, but there's not enough heat left forkisses. The Second Law states that while theenergy of the universe is constant, the entropy—the disorder—tends towards the maximum:it means all of our letters and dried flowers aredispersed between our homes, but you cannotcollect cream by stirring your coffee backwards,you cannot make bodies that have cooled keepgiving to bodies that are warm, and you cannotrun the other way so fast that you would giveme back what we’ve lost—you cannot stirthings apart—candles burn out no matter howtall no matter how bright leaving us all in thedark because the Second Law says that we areall doomed says heat death that the sun willburn itself out and we will all freeze says beddeath that you and I will burn ourselves outand our love will freeze in the sheets becauseheat goes only one way which means you willlove me brightest and hottest until you don'tuntil the candle the bed or the very sun burn out ",1

Neighbours injecting turbulence, downstream disturbances rocking chaos in blades, flailing me still. I extract nothing. There’s an optimal size, calculable.

But even in this disposition, gains vanish as the surface wind slows, the gathering crowd murmuring a uniform wake, airless turbulence even in the stairwell even in the car park even outside the store on the ground floor where teenagers vape and orange light from missing cigarettes somehow still burn in the dark.Sizevolumecapacity depending on the atmosphere above and the latitude of the party and how long it’s been since I stood beside another turbine,heard the rush of airand felt the warmth of groundbreaking energy.

Your cervical vertebrae let youhang your head or hold it high, and shake it “yes” or “no.”The hyoid bone attaches to muscles (the hyoglossus, the stylohyoid)you use to wag your tongue and say whatever you please.In the eight minutes that Derek Chauvin’s patellaknelt on his cervical vertebrae George Floydused the muscles attached to his hyoid boneto say: “Please, please, please”and: “I can’t breathe”and: “Mama!” In Houston, where George Floyd and I grew up(eight miles and twenty years apart)your melanin once determined whereyou could eat and drink and rest your bones. The bones of many, many men whose skin was rich in melanin now rest 18 miles southwest of downtown Houstonin unmarked graves at the Imperial State Prison Farm in Sugarland, Texas.There Edward Cunningham and Littleberry Ellis reinvented the old plantation, leasing prisoners to cut cane, sunup ‘til dark, until the hard-boiled men they rented dropped dead in the fields. Huddie Ledbetter tried to warn George Floyd about the knee on the neck and the meaning of melanin,tried to teach him what all he had learned in 7 yearsstripping and chopping and boiling down cane inthe “Hellhole-on-the-Brazos.” Ledbelly sang: “If you ever go to Houston, boy, you better walk rightand you better not squabble, and you better not fight.” But the Statesman stated: “All men are created equal,” and the Preacher preached: “Free at last, free at last,”‘til all those stirring words, reverberating, slurred the melanin in George Floyd’s inner ear. Derek Chauvin was born and raised in Minneapolis,Minnesota, not far from Fort Snelling where Dred and Harriet Scott lived togetherwith their master, an army surgeon,(just fifteen minutes from the Cup Foods store where George Floyd’s neck will be forever linked to Derek Chauvin’s knee).Even before we had a Constitution to guarantee the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, the Northwest Ordinance outlawed slavery in Wisconsin Territory, so you can see how, up to the moment when Judge Taney returned them to servitude in St. Louie,the Scotts (just like George Floyd) might beforgiven for thinking they were free. When Dr. John Emerson, the man who owned the Scotts,was forced to amputate a soldier’s leg(crushed by a cannonball, or shot with lead,or studded with Saukie arrowheads)he saved the patella to make “a fine stump capable of bearing the full weightof the body.” The full weight of Officer Chauvin’s body,transferred throughhis kneecap tothe bones inGeorgeFloyd’sneck confirms our diagnosis that the sickness to be feared is not the trauma but the undebrided wound— the sepsis, uncontested, that taints the bloodand rots the flesh away. “Pyaemia,” Dr. Emerson would say, grunting over his bone saw. What todaywe call a staph infectionand treat with medicine. ",1

It does not say “do not touch”yet you still did not touch.Wary of the previous warnings,passing through friction and tension. Touching whatever your hands could reach,lured with curiosity and fueled by temptation.Immune with this kind of tactility,transgressing the liminality between desire and action.

"DOWN HOUSE, KENT, 1878 Je ne vois qu‘infini par toutes les fenêtresCharles Baudelaire, Le Gouffre I I’d one day meant to count the paceseach way out and back, but never did. The number of my steps increases with every passing season, but by the world itself, and by the provident thought it instigates, I’m pitched relentlessly onward, headlong into the unimagined with each unsteady stride, intrepid as some mutton-chopped, bullock-muscledathlete or hairy circus performer in a skintight suitpoised high above the gaping throng, or withthe scrupulous caution of the shuffling codger that I am in fact, this hoary creature that age and work and illness made, all my voyaging long since passed, when contemplations loiter far behind me,turning in madcap circles or lunging out ahead,impatient of my over-wary syllogizing, like loosed hounds outpacing my dim, path-shackled sight, impatient, imploring, at every distant turn. I like to imagine that this dear old Thinking Path knows my footfall well after all the years of quiet pacing in every weather, after the morning’s sick headache has at last subsided, the bed-sweats and vomiting and angry bowel for a short while held at bay. Wrapped in muffler, coat and gloves today, I imagine that it knows the scraping sound, the grimdetermined grind of gravel beneath my boot. Familiar of my wondering pauses, my frequent fits and starts, this stand of poplars will attest to my desultory progress, year in, year out, as it tightly frames the narrow pathof this modest voyaging of mine, corseted and cossetted, sweetly swaddled in the soothing rounds of happy domesticity, my unquiet cogitations come to rest these not quite forty yearsin Kentish country. From the bosom of a loving family,from the shelter of this house, past borders and woodlands,kitchen garden, orchard and greenhouses, I wander out and back, and thus far always out again. II I read this morning how one quite distinguished parson in a neighboring county, bright beaconof his congregation, has grandly titled me “The Guy Fawkes of Faith, Arsonist of Belief,” sworn enemy of Family, Home and Nation,whose object is none other than to set aflame the mansions of Heaven and leave a bloody, smoking charnel-house in the place of our good God’s creation. But rest assured, dearest Vicar, it is not.The world, my friend, is more eloquent by far, I’ve found, than my own poor plodding prose could ever be, and speaks quite clearlywhat it is. Its creatures too abide where each onesays exactly how it’s made, and how it came to be, if we might only learn to listen. My objective, if objective I have, is just to bea better listener than we have been, to amass the massive evidence of the living, past and present, and to offer you the story all things tell. And if it’s glory you’re after, what grander stuff than the eloquence incarnate of mollusk and musk-ox, penstemon and pangolin,hawk and hazelnut, aster, asparagus and ape?And if it’s impiety you deplore, what greater impiety than to shout down this very voice you call Creation,to silence all the world with mighty fulminations and those smug, impious certainties we call faith?No, dear Padre, let us all seek humility. My feeble witmay not find your God here, for the life of me,but keen discerning such as yours just might. III Notice the sound he makes, our prelate in his rage,the desperation in his voice, its rising pitch and panic.For I’ll waver he has understood me better even than my dear old Huxley has, and hears life’s oceans pounding at his bastioned shore, where each man stands,his own Albion, to preserve inviolate his lonely bordered soul in hopes of future glory, but now must hear me tell himof the here and now he flees in horror, tell him thatwe are many, tell him we are never one alone,that every creature houses others in its curious skin,this skin that time has woven from the porous membranesof our many-bodied world. IV If I’m not mistaken, tomorrow’s light should seea vast pelagic swarm intrude upon this newly stubbled ground,my neighbor’s field, a maritime incursion from the skythat wanders up the estuaries seeking forage, leaving tilth,for every boundary on this earth, like the sugared chambers of the flesh, is but a flagrant invitation, the perverse locusof promiscuous exchange and penetration. V Great clouds of starling swarm, shape-shiftingover the harvested field beyond the hedgerowwith the approach of autumn twilight. The poplar tops sway overhead in a breeze gone chilly now.Their drying leaves make a sound like rain. VI Shortly, my boy Francis will be out to fetch me in,but I’ll delay as long as I am able in this waning light, for the worthy parson’s vituperations have set me to thinking.I do now wonder at it all, and thrill. How thrilling to discernfrom the great body of evidence we call Naturethat creation has no end, that the inexhaustibly malleable stuff of us, whose fabric we will one day uncover, is fashioned into this curious world’s astounding spectacleof canny creatures by this glorious old, self-authoring world itself, this world devoid of closure, this worldof fecundity and change and endless exposure to change,this vivid, churning manufactory of teeming replication and variation, of multiplicity and diversity, of provident complexity and pitiless cruelty, yes, and of boundless, dumbfounding, luminous beauty.And I did anticipate that this would happen,the seething Jeremiad, the vile invective, the odorof Sulphur everywhere. I delayed the publicationof these modest observations and conclusions,these unexpected fruits of travel and repose,endured those twenty years of stubborn reticence, not only for the sake of my own beloved Emma, but fearing such ferocity from the very likes of our irate divine, from the imputation of insult, offense, defilement of his fraternity’s fond devotion to the stories our fathers told, from those who’d fathom in my candid contemplations not just an assault on heaven, but more pernicious still, the final removal of humankind from center stage in this untidy drama of our universe, the Copernican revelation that the story of this worldis grander by a long shot than all the solemn installations of a human pathos at the roiling hub of time’s creation. VII I see lamplight in the windows of the house now,and my devoted Francis will soon be walking toward meto take my arm and lead me home, and in my mind’s eye,I see the quiet vicarage in that neighboring county,like our own dear Down a sanctuary, fashioned with the Englishman’s special genius for leafy ease and patriarchy, and imagine the worthy prelate in his armchair, confecting the lofty sentences of next Sunday’s sermon. And I seem to see myself as well here, when indisposition or inclement air forbids the prospect of an excursion out onto this path, when after hours spent squinting at my specimen-trays, or teasing out the mysteries of filiationin my own inscrutable offspring, I turn to snatch a glimpse of sky and weather, and like that irascible poet-genius of our age, seem only able to behold infinity out all the windows.

"Daily I am haunted. Haunted by the carbon-laced corpses of shrubberies, reptiles, and sea anemonesFossilized over millions of years in tombs of coal, oil, and natural gas.

"My God, is this the end, where all is lost,Where all I strived for, all I ever wroteIs trampled to the ground? I could not thinkI would be like this, but when Schaffgotsch came,I shrank in the cathedral at his wordsAs he in sheepskin gloves could only lookMe over with disdain. My dirty handsHe took, and turning said, “Beware of himWho turns from God, while deigning to insteadIn glassy temples seek the fading blooms,And stains new paper fit for hymns with talesAnd sketches crude of what he there observes.He pries the widened leaves apart, and twistsThem with the pages of the Word to makeFalse laurels for his own. Hands smeared with dirt,He gains the earth, but loses his own self.”Then at the Gottesdienst he looked at meOne final time, and said, “Heed thus, Mendel,Make no path for yourself but of this verse:Dein Wille geschehe.¹” Dein Wille geschehe! I had known those words,New-painted on a slate within the roomWhere I’d been left behind, for I could doNaught in my childhood sickness. So I lay,And finding meager comfort from the fire, I fixed my eyes upon the little tile, Till sleep would come at last. The words remained, Etched in a cross about my neck, that I Would turn within my hands, alone insideThe room where strict examiners once askedMe questions that the answers never followed.And in the colours of cathedral glass,Where Augustine was crafted as he saidTo mark these words, for all that ever wasBut points to Him. My God, if, as they say, it is Your willThat I must cast away my work, then IShould think to blot my tables, shut these notes,And bury them beneath the painted scrolls.I should think all these things-- and yet within,I know I cannot pry my mind awayFrom all the quietness of rustling flowersThe garden Pisum had in early spring.They brimmed against the air as they would swellTowards the greenhouse arch, and I would sitAnd brush fine pollen grains from gentle bloomsLike strokes on paper. My God who loves the flowers of the field,Who clothes them in deep purple and in white,Is it such sin to know the way You madeThe beauty of their habits, which they shareWith all their children? I remember whenI traced the very nature of their hue,The very path it took as it was drawnFrom old to young. And that relief I feltTo realize that though I only sawOne predecessor’s mark, the other oneHad not been lost, but still was carried down,And lay within; that comfort to have knownThat none were meant to have been left behind.I once recall a service where I satStill as a child --where I first heard the verse--And there I heard the preacher talk at lengthOf birds, and how not one was left, or layOutside their Father’s care. O Augustine,Who said that all things do but point to God,Do all these notes and tables then but placeA light towards the love they call divine,Where all small things are e’er attended to,And, by Your will, none should be left behind? If such things should be worthy, Lord, then IShall keep these notes, as science and as praise.And if the message may not come to lightWithin this time, then may You keep it asA flower’s hue. For if it is not seenBy those who pass among this generation,Then may it lie there covered, but not cast,And there remain. For there may be a time,Where it is met (as flower-colours’ marksMeet one alike when carried down its path),With some like mind; and it resurfaces,Full and resplendent blooming to the sun. ¹Translates to “Thy will be done.” These words were printed on a tile in the living room of Mendel’s childhood home.

"We are the universe In terms of the universe,we are all particles;tiny, insignificant,even still, remarkable. In science, women have been written out.We are overshadowed and forgotten.Will history repeat itself? We are like hydrogen.A part of the composition of the universe,we are a fundamental feature of science,we are an essential element. Too small to see in the beginning,hidden in the shadows and obscure.But central to life on this earth,drink it in. We’ll just keep spinning. We are like dark matter,undiscovered, then unseen.But we shine bright, and we will rewritehistory, because there is no time machine. Think of Cecilia and her understanding of stars,or Lise and her discovery of fission.Once again they had to right their own memoirs,and paved the way for many women of ambition. Think of Katherine, her calculations got us to the moon,or, Dorothy, her coding launched satellites,and Mary, her advocacy made careers for women in STEM.Our eyes are open, and we’re crediting all of them. We understand.We research.We pioneer. Is the future a future we wantif it forgets about humanity?Science should not haunt,divide, or cause calamity. Surely our differences should be embraced,but in this universe I ask, sincerely,“Is there a place for me here?” ",1
"He picked his preservation: cost, two hundred thousand dollars. Dreamed of chilling out in an ice-box for a couple centuries, hoped some labcoats would read his contract and understand that they were bound to resurrect him, make him homo deus, bring the world to him again. He'd be stiff at first, shivering in this alien future, and his lips would be blue, frozen in a grin as his bet paid off. “Where are all you fuckers now?”he'd mutter as the labcoats moved off and the suits ticked a box. But if he stepped outside, the ground might shiver in longing beneath him, the earth taste his tender foot. “Come to me,” it would whisper. “Let me have you.” ",1

"Earth refuses to draw clean circles. In a seven-year itch, she shimmies round the sun with an inbuilt deviation from the true. What is truth? Not colouring inside the lines, nor toeing the line of little laws. Her fractal swing delights in shapes swerving off-kilter, a rock-and-rolling calligraphy of bad behaviour along the scroll of orbit. She sloshes oceans from neap to spring; a dizzy, uncircled dervish swirl, close to God. I am a whipped top, spinning only a moment before tipping from equilibrium; the gravity of doubt skews my axis and I can’t stand straight. I will go on, tilted. ",1
"Vast seas of space dust sank and caused the Earth to coalesce. Some four-point five-four billion years skipped forwards - more or less. Now, four-point five-four billion bounces lightly off the tongue, but, written out, the digits show that ‘long’ is really long. A. For 70 million years the Earth turned - barren as a brick. Then cloning carbon chains were forged; reactions did the trick. B. For 30 million years those chains were churned and tossed about, till some were fused by time and chance and single cells broke out. C. For 30 million more the cells were driven round the globe. These dots were bashed and crushed and smashed; they formed a faux microbe. D. The lifeline took a sudden leap: in just 4 million years the microbes learned to guzzle gas and fart through proto-rears. E. Next, vast amounts of time elapsed. You might feel addle-brained: nine hundred forty million years - then replication reigned. By now you’re probably confused by summing all this time. In brief, it took a billion years to cough-up micro-slime. F. The next epoch’s a real yawn-fest, when scumbags ruled the Earth. They fringed the shores with gloopy stuff – in regions north of Perth. A billion-year hiatus burbled on through tedious time. By Earth’s two-billionth birthday this was ‘Planet of the Slime’. This might have been life’s pinnacle (some Wags think this is true!) but Earth turned off the heaters and the saviour ice came through. G. The Earth was frozen solid and life’s neck was in a noose. It stayed like this nine million years - but O2 was let loose. H. The air began to thicken and the Earth began to warm. The scum learned how to soak-up heat - and life survived the storm. Now, if you’re going crazy and your brain’s about to crack, here comes the simple summary, to help you stay on track; To prep. the stock for life’s grand soup required 2 billion years. A little more than that, in fact. LIFE NEVER JUST APPEARS. I. Hurrah for photosynthesis! The scum gained ‘sort-of-leaves’ and dined on sunlight ‘ready-meals’. Now life rolled up its sleeves! It took 4 hundred-60 million years to make this stick. It was so very slow that imperceptible seems quick. J. Eukaryotic cannibals - the first of dog eats dog - began to scoff each other in that distant sloppy bog. These single cells were predators – the top-dogs of their days. They ruled 500 million years and split three separate ways. K. 6 hundred million years rolled by; these pinpricks made their moves. Though single-celled, these dots of life fell into different grooves. The fungi, plants and animals were seeded from these specks. The three-in-one branched out from here – each limb perfected sex. At last, the dog of trial and change was really off the leash, and life began exploiting what it found in every niche. The chapter ends with three full-stops – which mark the three-toed joint. Four-fifths of Earth’s account was spent. This is the take-home point! 3.64 billion years is four-fifths of Earth’s lot. A mere 900 million more leads to the present spot. ",1

"I’ve read that in ancient times People believed that fate controlled the future so completelyThat all fiction had to be set in the distant past. The past is where a story could really stretch out, where it could surprise you. The past as a blank canvas… No uncertainty in their future Today we are told not to worry about the past, we can’t change it anyway Whatever happened, happened Focus on the future Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Think and grow rich. If you can dream it, you can be it! The future is yours This much is certain If we combine the wisdom of the past and our modern life, then only the now is uncertain. This is certainly how it feels most days This we know for sure, except we don’t The thing about the classical world Is that it was classical The modern world, the quantum world is never certain The past may be Prolog The future may not yet be written But neither can escape uncertainty This we know for sure ",1

"Bobbing along in our little sea-crafts huddled against the swell of the tide that is pulled by a thread from the luminous moon, we occasionally unfurl enough to stretch and throw out a net to see what we might catch from the deeps of the existential sea of uncertainty waving at each other as if across a vast expanse of distance and time. We throw ourselves overboard, down in to the deep, to survey the night’s catch of silvery fish and delicate strands of life from where the unseen, simply felt, swell and drop of the ocean, lulls us along, the catch streaming through my fingers; gossamer threads that I weave and loop and knit together, the art and science in a pre-verbal loom that shuttles back and forth. Circular motion approaching the zone of instability and disorientation, where what was inside is now out and so on. An inversion and return of life to the self where we are the weaver and the loom. where what was opposite slowly comes together in a unity of creation to produce and pronounce that no longer must we divide to conquer but instead weave and weave and weave this matrix into a unified field. No more fragmented but instead the loom of our fabric of existence. It is in the way we weave together the art and science that produces the medicine we need for our age. Out of uncertainty comes the knowing of the mystery of life unfolding. Naming ‘what is’, making connections, going down deep, free us to behold what we are all engaged with instead of pining for a far-off utopian horizon at once transcendent mirage and a binding of our consciousness.

"A “cell” is only a four-letter word,but it means the whole living world.From bacteria to humans, the cell is an essential feature, the building block of each existing creature. As curious and eager scientists,we always love to zoom in on the tiny things.You will be surprised how much can happen in a cell,resembling an entire factory itself! As every other factory, the cell has its main station,which contains all the important information.I am sure you can guess this at the first try,yes, that’s right, they are called the nuclei! They encrypt their orders in the form of DNA,which can only be read by the messenger RNA.So, DNA into RNA is the cellular code of conduct,followed by RNA into protein – the main factory product. The protein is then processed through the endoplasmic reticulum track, which makes sure defective items will be kept back. But if everything in the process goes alright,the Golgi apparatus is our next site.This is where the protein product gets packaged,all prepared and ready to be passaged! Finally, all factories have their own source of energy –the mitochondrion, which saves the cell from going into lethargy.Now, imagine trillions of cells in creative synergismthis is what fuels the human organism! We hope you’ve enjoyed learning about the Cell unity.With love, from the Science Community! ",1

Perpetual motion, my orbit expands,My body is constantly making demands.The music engulfs me, it’s like a black holeOf darkness and nothing. It stretches my soul. Spaghettified sinew, centrifugal force,I spot as I spin now to lock me on course. Rotational motion towards no destination,A vision of fission in acceleration. Feeling faster than light as I’m spinning through air,I outstretch my galaxy arms like a prayer.It slows me (momentum is always conserved). Each moment of movement is closely observed. Momentum decreases. I subtly slow, With tension releasing I breathe in the flow. Impending inertia envelopes once more. I sigh as I stop and my foot hits the floor.

"Spark. The noise of the seismic source. Spark. The regular firing of electric pulse. Spark. Sending sound waves to the seabed. Spark. Through the sediments, reflecting from interfaces. Spark. Revealing past landscapes, buried and submerged. Spark. Process the signal. Through pulses of red and black set against an ivory backdrop that gleams from two screens, illuminating my face through wan winter light, I see shapes. Subtle curves in stacked traces, lost landforms, the geometries of gently delineated geomorphic density. As I scroll through seismic sections, sediments and stratigraphy synthesise and coalesce to form a real landscape in my mind. The swales and swells that emerge as I spin northeast, line after line, mouse button worked within a whisker of its life, reveal a landscape that existed, not persisted, for a brief moment between blue ice and blue sea.

I name the landforms as I encounter and explore them, Redshank Marsh, Avocet Estuary, Marram Barrier, Birch River. As I wander my mental landscape, I discover the fauna that already inhabits it, those sturdy-billed, bandy, burgundy-legged redshank, the piebald, curve-billed avocet, the sharp shards of matted marram grass that mantle the dunes, low-tangled shrub-forest of dwarf birch, resplendent with tiny jewels of sap-green leaf and catkin, that flank the bank of the wide, gravel-shingled braided river that once flowed across this landscape. Ten millennia later, these records of past landscapes lie beneath names from the shipping forecast, Forties, Dogger, Tyne, Humber. The coast of the past, a ghost of the land, becomes the foundation for the future. Turbine towers two hundred metres high, a sweep of scythe-blade steel, grounded in shifting seabed sediment.

"Tap dancing the leaves, Miss Droplet falls through, She sheds while she spins Her mist-erious truths Slow- motions the bark With the moistest of gaze slow dance in the dark In Romantic embrace. Drop slides down the stem, till she touches its knuckles. The soil exhales invitingly and smiles with a chuckle She’s Conducted yet not adhered[1], To the aggregates’ grip Percolating the soil matrix, she ventures down deep. This dirt maze fascinates her, It´s dark, but she won´t weep. Macro -corridors, micro- galleries, Animal Burroughs[2] writing songs in alley ways, Miss Droplet strikes a pose and pauses her travel, At the capillary Fringe[3] festival, on a stage made of gravel. She is happy, relentlessly waltzing around, with excited applause from her million hydrogen bonds[4] Her act is not finished, for she ain’t here alone. With Droplet came her sisters to the Critical zone[5]. Their dance performance is beautifully enticing, All water ladies synchronously tap dancing Their magical tapping was noticed  By plant roots up-taking Food and drink from the soil – new sap in the making Miss Droplet turned around pirouetting, the roots with a smile gifted. Smoothly she rose, levitating, for she was hydraulically uplifted. Pump me up, she said, I want to meet the Xylem[6], Take some, N, P, Ca[7] with you! Whispered her Psilocybe[8] kin. Some funk dance was long overdue... Our tap dancers whirled happy in the sap, Now was indeed time for more flow, for some good hydro rap. To the top, with the blob, pump them up, it won´t stop, Keep the water column going and pressure won´t drop. Days and nights she danced non-stop la bachata, “You forgot the blue sky”, Smiled wisely the bright stomata[9], Her juicy lips opened slow with a sigh, “It is time for you my dear, to get on your flight. Your brother the Cloud has long being awaiting. Vapour pressure deficit[10] will help you elevating, The wind shall help your recycle, Travel to your next adventure in our beloved (GREEN) WATER CYCLE [1] …adhered to the aggregates’ grip – water close to the soil aggregates can bind strongly to them via hydrogen bonds, referenced later in the poem. This is the so called capillary water, which is the portion of water less “mobile” in the soil. [2] Animal Burroughs – play on words, makes a reference to animal burrows, which are important pathways for water to infiltrate deeper in the soil, especially when soil is close to saturation. At the same time refers to William Burroughs, an American writer and visual artist (1914 - 1997). [3] capillary Fringe festival – play on words. Capillary fringe is the dynamic boundary between soil unsaturated and saturated with water. In this subsurface soil layer groundwater seeps up from a water table by capillary action to fill the soil pores. On the other hand, Fringe festival makes a reference to Edinburgh Fringe festival in Scotland, a major cultural event which takes place during the month of August and features thousands of artists and art disciplines. [4] hydrogen bond - an attractive force between a partially positive charged hydrogen (for example, found in the water molecule) and a partially negative charged atom (for example, a clay molecule part of a soil particle). [5] Critical zone - The Critical Zone is Earth's outer skin, which “extends from the top of the vegetation canopy through the soil and down to fresh bedrock and the bottom of the groundwater” (Grant & Dietrich, 2017). [6] Xylem - The tissue of vascular plants that conducts water and minerals, provides support, and can form the woody tissue of plants. [7] N, P, Ca – nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium. Essential nutrients for the plants, found in the soil [8] Psilocybe – genus of gilled fungus (mushrooms). Here their closeness to the plant roots alludes to the often symbiotic or mutualistic relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and plant roots. [9] stomata –microscopic openings on plant leaves which allow exchange of gases (water vapour, CO2, O2) with the atmosphere [10] vapour pressure deficit - the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and how much moisture the air can hold when it is saturated. Once air becomes saturated water will condense out to form clouds. High vapour pressure deficit favours evapotranspiration from plant leaves, but can also result in a “safety-driven” closure of stomata to avoid excessive water loss from the plant. ",1

"a theory that is based on two postulates (a) that the speed of light in all inertial frames is constant, independent of the source or observer. As in, the speed of light emitted from the truth is the same as that of a lie coming from the lamp of a face aglow with trust, and (b) the laws of physics are not changed in all inertial systems, which leads to the equivalence of mass and energy and of change in mass, dimension, and time; with increased velocity, space is compressed in the direction of the motion and time slows down.

I am a white dwarf, long in the truth

"Last Day in Space
Tomorrow we light our rocket,
we burn our engines and likewise,
burn a hole in the sky,
And thus fall toEarth.
How does one spend your last day in space?
Looking at Earth,
a blue jewel surrounded by inky blackness,
Pure Occipital Ecstasy.
Unconstrained by your girth,
you fly with vestigial wings.
The atmosphere on edge,
iridescent blue with no earthly parallel,
Electrifying Diaphanous Beauty.
Guarded by Sirens of Space,
singing saccharine songs,
beckoning you to crash on the atmos-reef
which tears you limb from limb
andscorching what remains
into cosmic croutons that sprinkle onto
the garden salad of Earth.
One last feast out the window,
A looking glass of Wonderland.
Offering both a portal to see your world,
and a translucent reflection to see yourself.
Contemplation;
what is your place in this worldbelow,
how do you change it,
how does it change you.
We are wedded to this planet,
until mass extinction we do part.
Perhaps one planet is not enough.
You study your charts,
we prepare our spaceship,
and our minds.
We make ready our descent,
into these seemingly gentle arms.
The eager anticipation of hugging your wife,
your boys with grins followed by pouting faces,
both excited to see you but not understanding why you left.
Oh how does one spend your last day in Space.
What would you do?

One or two spiders take off
And there are willow seeds in clouds
But I keep feeling (force 3) a scintillation,
As if a southerly light breeze
Was blowing the tips of my thoughts

(force 6) So I want to tell you how a whole tree sways to the left
But even as I say so (force 7) a persistent howl is blowing my hair horizontal
And even as I speak (force 8) this speaking becomes difficult
And now my voice (force 9) like an umbrella shaken inside out
No longer shelters me from the fact (force 10)

Is it the wind?

All the stars have wings
The sky so full of wings

The day conceals its brilliant face,
And dark night covers up the fields,
Black shadows creep upon the hills,
Light’s rays recede from us.
Before us gapes a well of stars –
Stars infinite, well fathomless.

A grain of sand in ocean swells,
A tiny glint in endless ice,
Fine ash caught in a mighty gale,
A feather in a raging fire,
So I am lost in this abyss,
Oppressed by thoughts profound.

The mouths of wise men call to us:
“A multitude of worlds dwell there,
Among them burning suns untold,
And peoples, and the wheel of time:
There, all of nature’s strength
Exists God’s glory to proclaim”

But where, O nature, is your law?
Dawn breaks from out of northern lands!
Is this the home of our sun’s throne?
Or are the icy oceans burning?
Behold, cold fire envelops us!
Behold, now day has entered night.

O thou, whose lively gaze can see
Into the book of law eternal,
For whom the smallest part of things
Reveals the code in all of nature,
Thou comprehendeth planets’ course,
Now tell us what disturbs our souls?

"And they collided;
Sending light and gravitational waves of a gamma-ray burst.
They were dead for a long time
From a supernova that killed all their electrons and protons,
And turned them into small, dense and heavy masses.
There are millions of them,
But these two came closer and closer,
With love as strong as their gravity,
And they collided.
The collision was spectacular,
A cosmic gold event that created real gold,
And uranium was created along with it.
Once they have been huge dazzling stars,
But they created a spectacle when they were dead.
 
Probably now we’ll have some answers,
On how the Universe was created and at what rate it is expanding,
And we’ll have no one thank other than these neutron stars,
Because they collided.

"The secret of these hills was stone, and cottages
Of that stone made,
And crumbling roads
That turned on sudden hidden villages
Now over these small hills, they have built the concrete
That trails black wire
Pylons, those pillars
Bare like nude giant girls that have no secret.
The valley with its gilt and evening look
And the green chestnut
Of customary root,
Are mocked dry like the parched bed of a brook.
But far above and far as sight endures
Like whips of anger
With lightning’s danger
There runs the quick perspective of the future.
This dwarfs our emerald country by its trek
So tall with prophecy
Dreaming of cities
Where often clouds shall lean their swan-white neck.

We were cast and wrought and hammered to design,

   And a thousandth of an inch to give us play:
And now, if you will set us to our task,
   We will serve you four and twenty hours a day!

      We can print and plough and weave and heat and light,
      We can run and race and swim and fly and dive,
      We can see and hear and count and read and write!

   If you’ll let us have his name and town and state,
You shall see and hear your crackling question hurled
   Across the arch of heaven while you wait.
Has he answered? Does he need you at his side?
   You can start this very evening if you choose,
And take the Western Ocean in the stride
   Of seventy thousand horses and some screws!

      The boat-express is waiting your command!
      You will find the Mauretania at the quay,
      Till her captain turns the lever ’neath his hand,
      And the monstrous nine-decked city goes to sea.

Do you wish to make the mountains bare their head
   And lay their new-cut forests at your feet?
Do you want to turn a river in its bed,
   Or plant a barren wilderness with wheat?
Shall we pipe aloft and bring you water down
   From the never-failing cisterns of the snows,
To work the mills and tramways in your town,
   And irrigate your orchards as it flows?

      It is easy! Give us dynamite and drills!
      Watch the iron-shouldered rocks lie down and quake
      As the thirsty desert-level floods and fills,
      And the valley we have dammed becomes a lake.

But remember, please, the Law by which we live,
   We are not built to comprehend a lie,
We can neither love nor pity nor forgive.
   If you make a slip in handling us you die!
We are greater than the Peoples or the Kings—
   Be humble, as you crawl beneath our rods!-
Our touch can alter all created things,
   We are everything on earth—except The Gods!

      Though our smoke may hide the Heavens from your eyes,

       It will vanish and the stars will shine again,

       Because, for all our power and weight and size,

       We are nothing more than children of your brain!

The Builder nods — the shackles, they unlock;

Aside — no longer is the bomb held fast,

But it was History, there for all to see, an image
As glorious as Galileo’s asterix-etched sketch of Jupiter’s
Mischevious moons, or Rosse’s portrait of the great
Whirlpool drawn at the Leviathan’s eye;
A record of a whisper that had travelled for more than a billion years,
So soft, so faint that the slow turn of a page
In a library’s quietest corner would sound as loud
As a hurricane’s howling wind to the instruments’ ears,
And the lifting of a single strand of a sleeping new-born’s hair
By a passing summer breeze would crack like a Balrog’s whip.
Hard to believe, looking at that jagged mountain range trace
That we were staring the deepest of deep physics in the face,
Looking back in time to when a pair of black holes danced,
Swirling dervishes, dense as 60 Suns,
Their shirts and skirts of Hawking radiation twirling as they whirled
Around each other in a giddy reel, then
Hurtled together at half the speed of Light –
What a sight that must have been,
But hominid eyes would not look to the sky for an eternity more,
And when it finally cocked an ear in their direction
LIGO could hear only echoes of their ancient laughter,
Waves tumbling in from the depths of space and time,
Lapping at our feet, rippling round, through and past the Earth
Like the melodies of distant whale-song.

Just inch by inch the mighty mass it slides.
An island of gigantic size — it shifts,
As on its shores now beat the timeless tides.
Upon a sea of molten rock it glides;
It slips — it’s driven by a starry force —
An engine that within its body hides,
Propelling it far from its primal source.
It journeys on a strange uncharted course,
Escaping from its motherland; its home
Now far behind, yet it feels no remorse —
Young continents, like children, tend to roam.
No trail it leaves; there is no wake to west.
It never tires, and never will it rest.

Shining like a wolf’s eye.

Will hike up Seth’s serrated cliffs
Until, high above Hapi’s sands
They’ll reach out with shaking hands
And drag it from its icy tomb
Into the light, setting it upright again,
Brushing years of ice and dust
From its face before taking it
To its final resting place – a glass case
At ESOC, spotlights warming it,
Thawing a century of frostbite…
But for now, Philae sleeps,
Without Rosetta’s alarm clock beep-beep-beep
Interrupting its dreams
Of what might have been,

If only it hadn’t bounced like a rubber ball…

Landing, legs splayed,
In a lonely hole hidden from the Sun’s precious rays…

No, not the ones you buy in stores,

And you know what that means.

Takes you and me, and makes us “us”
And makes us feel ‘twas ever thus?

Out of which he might deliver
Fusillades of Eros.

On–not why, but how;
The parasympathetic blush,
Adrenaline to bring a rush,
Are how, not why, I’ve got a crush
On you, my darling, now.
But if old Charles Darwin’s right,
The reason that the merest sight
Of you will always give delight
Is…reproductive fitness.
Throughout our species’ family tree,
Producing proper progeny
Is what determined you and me
And Darwin was the witness.
Is thinking that you’re oh so sweet
And how you’ll make my life complete
Some trick to make our gametes meet?
It seems it may be so.
I feel the way I feel today
Because some bit of DNA
Sees your genetics on display
And wants to say “hello.”
But think of this, for what it’s worth:
Millennia before my birth
That DNA had roamed the earth,
In residents thereof;
The neat thing is, it’s really true,
The feeling that I have for you
Although, of course, it feels brand-new
Is truly ageless love.

It is night’s terrors I must learn to love,
Or pray for day to some attentive god
Who on his cloud hears all my wishes,
Hears and refuses.
Light walks the sky, leaving no print,
And there is always day, the shining of some sun,
In those high globes I cannot count,
And some shine for a second and are gone,
Leaving no print.
But lunar night will not glow in my blackness,
Make bright its corners where a skeleton
Sits back and smiles, A tiny corpse
Turns to the roof a hideous grimace,
Or mice play with an ivory tooth.

As clearly as the light of my own brain,
Will only dim life, and light death.

"A mathematician fell madly in love
With a lady, young, handsome, and charming:
By angles and ratios harmonic he strove
Her curves and proportions all faultless to prove.
As he scrawled hieroglyphics alarming.
He measured with care, from the ends of a base,
The arcs which her features subtended:
Then he framed transcendental equations, to trace
The flowing outlines of her figure and face,
And thought the result very splendid.
He studied (since music has charms for the fair)
The theory of fiddles and whistles,-
Then composed, by acoustic equations, an air,
Which, when ’twas performed, made the lady’s long hair
Stand on end, like a porcupine’s bristles.

The lady loved dancing:-he therefore applied,

To the polka and waltz, an equation;
But when to rotate on his axis he tried,
His centre of gravity swayed to one side,
And he fell, by the earth’s gravitation.
No doubts of the fate of his suit made him pause,
For he proved, to his own satisfaction,
That the fair one returned his affection;-“because,
“As every one knows, by mechanical laws,
“Re-action is equal to action.”

Their knotted ganglions shall wax firm
Till your strong flagstones heave and toil.

And when, to grasp more power and feasts,
Its ores are emptied, wasted, lack’d,
The middens of your burning beasts
Shall be raked over till they yield
Last priceless slags for fashioning high,
Ploughs to wake grass in every field,
Chisels men’s hands to magnify.

leading into a mystery
deepening about you.
What are you trying to discover
beyond the zone of habit
and enforced convention?
There is the animus
that spends itself on images,
the most complex being
convention and habit.
You shall form patterns                       
of research and bind yourself
to laws within your knowledge,
and always conscious of your limitations
make settlement,
with patience to instruct you
as it always does
in your research: an arrangement
spanning an abyss of time,
and you will find yourself patient
when you are questioned.

In her complacent ministry of fear,

Or be wiped out. Will she be asked to show

To some star off there, say, a half light-year
Through temperature of absolute zero?

"A line that looks dead straight can be an arc
like the horizon when you’re out at sea.
True distance is deceptive: in the dark

A line that should be straight becomes an arc,

Since distance can’t be measured in the dark
most people turn the light on. And the stark
divisions blind them with geometry.
A line that isn’t straight is called an arc—
no! Think outside the box! Perhaps a quark
moves like a knight in chess, a hop-two-three.

Underground astronauts

Through narrow clefts, over parlous depths

When, when will come the flowering, the flowing,
The pulsing, the awakening, the taking wing,
The long longed-for night of the bridegroom’s coming.

"A brilliant poem about Exo-planets, thanks Kate!
Kate's Science - Real and Fantastic
Stars wobble in our telescopes,
Luminosities diverge,
And from such tiny signals
Their planets do emerge.
Thousands of stars host planets,
Giants of swirling gas,
And some that seem more earthly
In their orbits and their mass.
But each of these is distant,
Lifetimes away for certain.
How ever will we know if
There’s life upon the surface?
Light filters through their atmospheres,
When atmospheres they own.
Molecules split spectra
Into patterns that are known.
Life creates imbalances,
Whatever life may be,
However strange,
Disequilibrium
Points to biology.
And so we have a protocol
As we gather specks of light,
Photons that passed through planets’ air
On their interstellar flight…
Will tell us if there’s oxygen
Or methane, CO2,
Water vapor, nitrogen,
Or ozone in the brew.
And tease us with the knowledge
That beyond our current grasp
Creation may have left its mark,
A hand we cannot clasp.

“The Geometry of Gravity,”
reads the card of the museum’s display
where metal spheres are leisurely launched
along the lip of a parabolic funnel.

They eddy in a sort of perpetual motion,
their descent as imperceptible as inevitable.

Early on, they collide, kissingly,
as the longer rolling elliptically hoist themselves
into intersecting orbits.
Fresher launches define their fall
with ever increasing velocity
into accelerated, deeper orbits,
more stable, circular and unique.

Their increasing forward speed
diminishes their descent
till they blur into fevered coils
hung stationary at the funnel’s neck.

They vibrate aggressively

"When moles still had their annual general meetings

So they elected a commission to ascertain what was above.
The commission dispatched a sharp-sighted fleet-footed

caught sight of a tree with a bird on it.
Thus a theory was put forward that up above
birds grew on trees. However,
some moles thought this was
too simple. So they dispatched another
mole to ascertain if birds did grow on trees.
By then it was evening and on the tree
some cats were mewing. Mewing cats,
the second mole announced, grew on the tree.
Thus an alternative theory emerged about cats.
The two conflicting theories bothered an elderly
neurotic member of the commission. And he
climbed up to see for himself.
By then it was night and all was pitch-black.
Both schools are mistaken, the venerable mole declared.
Birds and cats are optical illusions produced
by the refraction of light. In fact, things above
Were the same as below, only the clay was less dense and
the upper roots of the trees were whispering something,

And that was that.

You beach your beauty

lured off course and hurled
through waves of coronal mass ejection,
fought hard to correct your navigation.
You collided with the shore

"
I wrote my abstract, sent it in,
With words that don’t offend.
Imagine my horror to find that I
Am scheduled at the end.
Let me say, to be last speaker,
There are very few things worse.
And so this talk, to get revenge,
Will be entirely in verse.
The subject I address today
Is that of star formation.
And what we’ve found out recently
About the situation.
Stars start out as clouds of gas and
Dust and bits of spinning stuff.
Collapsing gravitationally
Until they’re dense enough.
They form themselves in little lumps,
(Or so says this bloke Jeans).
‘Dynamic Instabilities’
Whatever that term means.
A protostar is thus created,
Igniting nuclear fuel.
Before too long the star begins
To really lose its cool.
A massive wind begins to blow;
No one’s quite sure why.
But it’s quite clear the gas and stuff
Begins to really fly.
Well, from all this result what’s called
Protostellar outflow.
Bipolar, fast, and hot as hell —
We see it in CO.
But radio can’t tell us much;
There are but few transitions,
And cool CO’s so common, it
Confuses most positions.
So, most of what we know of this
Comes from the infrared —
That bit of spectrum in the middle
That decent people dread
Way back in 1976,
2 Micron lines were found
In Orion where, I’m sure you know,
Molecules abound.
Now everyone was most surprised,
These lines put out much power.
No one thought they’d be that strong —
Not even Neugebauer.
The lines were due to hydrogen
Molecules, and they
Don’t emit much until heated
To at least two thousand K
Well, people studied this for years,
Finding H2 everywhere.
But still these lines don’t tell you what
Density is there.
What we need’s another line:
Density dependent.
This view needs no genius
In order to defend it.
I’ve talked for several minutes now,
(I’ve half an hour to go),
I’m sure you’re most surprised I haven’t
Mentioned yet the KAO
Carbon monoxide, really hot,
Has heaps of good transitions
Depending critically upon
The density conditions.
These lines are in the far — IR,
But wait — here’s the best bit —
To see them you will need to use
The KAO, you guessed it!
In 1980, from the plane, we
Found it in Orion,
But no more CO could we find
Despite long hours of flyin’.
So models of Orion’s shock
Were looking really grand,
But it remained the only source
We claimed to understand.
We needed several other sources,
All of which we’d then compare.
But when we looked for shocked CO,
We always found it wasn’t there.
And so I searched for southern sources
Of this shocked H2,
And found it, in G333
Point six, minus, naught point two.
It’s really very, very bright
And made us all quite happy.
The data’s good, the lines are strong
(Though the slide don’t look real snappy.)
So, if we want to search again
For shocked CO, and wouldn’t you?
What better place than G333
Point six, minus, naught point two!
The problem with this new-found source,
I hardly need to warn you,
Is that it’s too far south to see
From sunny California.
And so to us the Kuiper came;
In May last year it made it.
The cost was astronomical,
But NASA mainly paid it.
Thus we made a set of flights
From Richmond Airforce Base.
One such flight is shown right here:
Our tracks’s this dotted trace.
How the instrument is made
Upon this slide is told;
It uses liquid helium
To keep all these bits cold.
Well, here’s the data — please don’t laugh,
It often looks this way.
A few times through the VAX and then
We’ll publish it as Ap J.
The line is there, I kid you not,
This dip here’s just the sky.
To see the peak you simply need
A good impartial eye.
Least-squares fitting gives a curve
From which derive the facts.
(Oh, let me thank the AAO
For lending me their VAX.)
Vlsr is fifty-three.
It’s pleasing, as you see.
The radio line velocities
More or less agree.
Intensity is really weak:
It’s two point nought by ten.
To the minus eighteenth power
(In watts per square cm.)
That’s thirty times as weak as we
Detected in Orion.
No wonder it took several years
Of concentrated tryin’
Well, as you see, I dont yet have
Any numbers clear
For density, and things like that.
(It’s only been a year.)
But now we have not one, but two
CO sources, it is true:
Orion, and this G333
Point six, minus, naught point two.
In fact, the sources now are three
Because, again last May,
The very next flight that we did
Found CO in Sgr A.
Well, thank you all for listening
(Though some of you have slept)
I wonder now, will Dick McGee
This manuscript accept?",1

Is a fact one can hardly doubt,

Felt certain still that the mind
Is free to know or not.

BUBBLE UNIVERSES

Our universe may be embedded in
a bulk containing other bubble realms,
while we are just a hologram within.
The implication is what overwhelms.

Though this explains why gravity’s perverse,
our cosmos, then, is not the whole shebang.
Are we part of a frothy multi-verse
where one’s black hole is another’s Big Bang?

Is our universe the one that God meant
or just one result of experiment?

"Carbon comes in many forms
Hard as diamond, soft as soot
Coal or graphite when we write
And fancy fullerine to boot.
Carbon chains are straight or branched
Or closed to form a ring
Organic compounds these are called
Parts for life they bring.
Coal and oil and fuel gas
Once mined they have much worth
These reservoirs of energy
Were once alive on earth.
When carbon joins with oxygen
It’s either two or one
The double causes drinks to fizz
The single one? you’re gone.
I mean carbon dioxide’s fairly good
Most days it is our friend
But carbon monoxide’s something else
One miss can mean the end.

With thrust to our backs while we speed on our way

The color of loneliness changes its hue
And a radio call to our mission control
Takes nearly a day to just say hello
Yet our boss back on Earth abstract from our flight
Has no understanding of our minds in this plight
The Siren’s of Space singing songs for our souls
Try to tempt us to ruin on the reef of black holes

For better or worse, you can’t hear a scream
Over eyes with wax patches, we resist Siren’s call
Thus avoiding the reef and escaping the fall

With or without us their life does go on
For the future of Earth and the human race
The final frontier we seek will be space
Our minds thus expand into places unknown

It filled Gallileo with mirth
To watch his two rocks fall to Earth.
He gladly proclaimed,
“Their rates are the same,
And quite independent of girth!”
Then Newton announced in due course
His own law of gravity’s force:
“It goes, I declare,
As the inverted square
Of the distance from object to source.”
But remarkably, Einstein’s equation
Succeeds to describe gravitation
As spacetime that’s curved,
And it’s this that will serve
As the planets’ unique motivation.

By a new way of thinking we’re smitten.

Attempting to learn

Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release
From dusty bondage into luminous air.

"I dreamed I saw a galaxy explode,
A massive spiral champion shorn of arms,
And eons passed in seconds through my brain;
The evolution of the cosmic wheel,
The whirling stellar city born of gas,
Had finished in a scattering of stars;
Where stars had moved in orbits, night remained.
I dreamed I saw the universe explode,
The clusters and the superclusters dash
In routed panic, as my eyes supposed,
From one another; yet between their paths,
Along their paths of flight, below, above,
Passed vehicles on journeys none foresee:
Imagination crumbled at the sight.
I dreamed I saw an ultracluster turn,
And watched the superclusters move on paths
Within this mightiest of structured forms
Of which the whole creation has been made;
I saw the stars burn out, the galaxies
Disperse and perish, till the turning form
Sped like a cinder through infinity.

There vacuum is the void.

Humanity, however,

A certain soldier
    had to fire a cannon at six o’clock sharp every evening.
    Being a soldier he did so. When his accuracy was
    investigated he explained:




I go by

    forty-five I set my watch by it and
    climb the hill where my cannon stands ready.
    At seventeen fifty-nine precisely I step up to the cannon
    and at eighteen hours sharp I fire.


And it was clear
    that this method of firing was absolutely accurate.
    All that was left was to check that chronometer. So
    the clockmaker down in the city was questioned about
    his instrument’s accuracy.


Oh, said the clockmaker,
    this is one of the most accurate instruments ever. Just imagine,
    for many years now a cannon has been fired at six o’clock sharp.
    And every day I look at this chronometer
    and always it shows exactly six.
